Preface 

Rice is among the three most important grain crops in the world, and it has a major  
contribution to fulfill the food needs across the globe. The role of rice crop is inevi- 
table in the current and future global food security. Rice is grown in Asia, Americas,  
Australia,  Europe,  and Africa  following  diverse  production  practices.  Pests  and  
other problems, genotypes, and management practices in rice vary greatly in differ- 
ent  parts  of  the  world.  Such  difference  are  needed  to  be  highlighted  in  order  to  
understand  and  improve  the  global  rice  production.  Our  book  ‘Rice  Production  
Worldwide’ will help the readers to understand the past trends in global rice produc- 
tion, the current cultures of rice production in a global perspective, and the changes  
that are required to improve and sustain the rice productivity in different regions. In  
this book, we have addressed the rice origin, history, role in global food security,  
rice physiology, major rice producing areas of world (their importance, characteris- 
tics of rice cropping systems, management practices; salient technologies involved,  
merits and demerits of the particular systems), major rice production systems (con- 
ventional flooded system, aerobic rice system. etc.), rice cultivars, fertilizer man- 
agement, and pest management in rice. Further, we have highlighted the harvesting,  
threshing, and processing of rice as well as the role of biotechnology in improving  
the rice production, quality, and nutrition. The book is equally advantageous for  
academicians, researchers, students, and farming community.

Chapter 1: 
Current Status, Challenges, and Opportunities  
in Rice Production 

Rajendra Prasad, Yashbir Singh Shivay, and Dinesh Kumar 

1.1      Introduction 

Rice is grown in all the six continents of the world (Asia, Africa, Australia, Europe,  
North America, South America) where field crop production is practiced leaving  
only the icy continent of Antarctica, where no crops are grown. Rice is the staple  
food for nearly half of the world’s population. Rice has been a part of the cultural  
identities of several countries, and a number of festivals are related to the rich har- 
vest  of  rice,  e.g.,  Pongal,  Onam,  and  Bihu  in  India,  Rub  Kwan  Khao  in  central  
Thailand (www.ricewisom.com), Harvest Moon in China and Chu Suk in Korea  
(everything ESL.net), Dewi Sri in Indonesia, Santabary festival in Madagascar, and  
Amu festival in Ghana. In these festivals, the first grains of rice are offered to ven- 
eration God. Rice harvest festivals are also organized in southern states of the USA,  
namely, Arkansas and Louisiana, as a fair with lots of fun, food, and merrymaking.  
Rice is mentioned in Rig Veda and Mahabharata (Nene  2012; Prasad et al. 2016)  
and in the Bible (Rubin 2004). 
    Rice has now become a foreign exchange earner for several countries and is  
playing a role in their economies. Top ten rice exporting countries in 2014 were  
India, Thailand, Pakistan, the USA, SR Vietnam, Italy, Uruguay, Brazil, China,  
and Australia, respectively (Table  1.1) (Workman 2015). The largest rice import- 
ing  regions  are  Middle  East  and  sub-Saharan  and  Western  Africa  (Adjao  and  
Staatz 2015). 
    In recent years, there have been three major studies on probable trends in the rice  
markets over the coming decades, namely, USDA (2013) for the period 2011–2022,  
University of Arkansas, USA (Wailes and Chavez 2012), and OECD/FAO (2013).

(Workman 2015) 

The general conclusions are as follows: (1) Asia will continue to dominate the world  
rice economy, and (2) likely increase in world rice consumption is expected at 1 %  
per annum (pa); the rates may be higher in the Middle East and sub-Saharan Africa.  
According to OECD/FAO projections, rice–coarse grain price ratio may fall from  
2.5 in recent years to 1.9 by 2022, and the rice–wheat price ratio may fall marginally  
from 1.8 to 1.7. This indicates some disadvantage to rice over coarse grains. 
    Success  of  the  Green  Revolution  in  the  late  1960s  witnessed  a  steady  rise  in  
Asia’s per capita rice consumption, where it increased from 85 kg per year in the  
early 1960s to nearly 103 kg in the early 1990s. During the same period, global per  
capita rice consumption increased from 50 to 65 kg per annum. During this period  
(1960s–1990s), the global rice consumption increased from 150 to 350 million met- 
ric tons (MMT) due to two factors: (1) increased per capita rice consumption and (2)  
more than twofold increase in Asia’s population. However, since the early 1990s,  
strong economic growth in many Asian countries, particularly in China and India,  
halted the upward trend in global per capita rice consumption as consumers diversi- 
fied their diet from rice to high-value products such as meat, dairy products, fruits,  
and vegetables. A recent analysis has shown a declining trend in the contribution of  
rice toward total calorie intake by humans in Asian countries; the contribution of  
rice toward total calorie intake by humans changed from 30.2 % in 1961 to 26.8 %  
in  2007  in  China,  while  it  changed  from  79.1  %  in  1961  to  69.8  %  in  2007  in  
Bangladesh (Timmer  2010). In 1961, the contribution of rice toward total calorie  
intake was 30.2 % in China and 79.1 % in Bangladesh, and in 2007 it was declined  
to 26.8 % in China and 69.8 % in Bangladesh. It is predicted that this trend will  
provide a check and limit the demand for rice to 501 MMT as against a production  
of 502.7 MMT in 2021–22 (Wailes and Chavez 2012). 

1.2      Origin of Rice and Taxonomy 

The   cultivated   rice   belongs   to   the   family   Poaceae   (Gramineae),   subfamily  
Bambusoideae, tribe Oryzeae, and genus Oryza. The genus Oryza has been divided  
into  four  species  complexes:  (1)  sativa  complex,  (2)  officinalis  complex,  (3)  

----------------------- Page 10-----------------------

1   Current Status, Challenges, and Opportunities in Rice Production                        3 

meyeriana complex, and (4) ridley complex (Khush 2005). Only Oryza sativa com- 
plex has two cultivated species, namely, O. sativa and O. glaberrima Steud. Oryza  
sativa, the Asian rice, is grown worldwide, while O. glaberrima is grown on a lim- 
ited acreage in a few African countries. The species in other  Oryza complexes are  
wild types. The major problem with the wild types was lodging and shattering of  
grain and domestication selection focused on plants that had less lodging and shat- 
tering (Callaway 2014). 
   The  two  major  subspecies  of  O.  sativa,  namely, japonica   and  indica,  are  
more closely related to distinct wild varieties than they are to each other, point- 
ing to two separate regions of domestication: japonica  in China and  indica in  
India (Gross and Zhao  2014). Japonica and  indica share identical non-shatter  
mutations in gene sh4. However, it is suggested (Sang and Ge  2013) that the  
mutation arose in an ancestor of japonica  rice first and then found its way to  
indica. In China, the domestication may have taken place in the lower end of  
Yangtze River Valley (Vughan et al.  2008; Fuller et al. 2009) or in the Pearl  
River Valley (Huang et al. 2012). It is certain that the origin of rice lies in the  
region of Asia covering Assam-Meghalaya area of India and river valley regions  
of  southeast  China  (Swaminathan   1984;  Fuller  2011).  Indicas  are  grown  
throughout the tropics and subtropics. Traditional indicas are characterized by  
tall stature, weak stem, droopy leaves, high tillering capacity, long grains, and  
poor  response  to  high  nutrient  input  conditions.  Japonicas  have  stiff,  short  
stalk,  and  erect  type  with  round  grains  and  are  highly  responsive  to  nutrient  
inputs. These are limited to the temperate zones. A third subspecies, which is  
broad  grained  and  thrives  under  tropical  conditions,  was  identified  based  on  
morphology and initially called javanica , but is now known as tropical japon- 
ica.  Examples  of  this  subspecies  include  the  medium  grain  “Tinawon”  and  
“Unoy”  cultivars,  which  are  grown  in  the  high-elevation  rice  terraces  of  the  
Cordillera Mountains of northern Luzon, Philippines. Because of high yields  
and economic returns, International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), Philippines,  
developed two cultivars of japonica  suitable for tropics, which are NSIC Rc170  
or IRRI 142 (now called MS11) and NSCIC Rc220 or IRRI 152 for large-scale  
cultivation in the Philippines (Kang 2010). 

1.3      Area, Production, and Consumption 

Although rice yields are still growing, the rate of growth has been declining; com- 
pound growth rate was 2.5 % per annum (pa) during 1962–1979 and declined to  
1.4 % pa during 1980–2011 (Adjao and Staatz 2015). The cereal production fore- 
cast by Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) in April–June 2015 indicated that  
out of the total cereal production of 2524.3 MMT, the contribution of rice (milled),  
wheat, and coarse grains is likely to be 500.5 MMT, 723.4 MMT, and 1300.3 MMT,  
respectively. At the global level, the share of rice in total cereal production did not  
change significantly between 1961 and 2007, starting from 24.6 % and gradually  
reaching to 28.1 % (Timmer  2010); thus, about 20 % of cereal production in the  
world is going to be rice.

Mha million hectares, MMT million metric tons of milled rice, MT ha−1 metric tons of milled rice  

per hectare 

    According to world rice outlook, rice-harvested area in the year 2015–2016 is  
likely to be 160 million hectares (M ha), and it is not going to change much by the  
year 2021–2022 (Table  1.2). About 80 % of the total global area under rice is in  
eight Asian countries, namely, China, India, Indonesia, Bangladesh, the Philippines,  
Vietnam, Thailand, and Myanmar, which are not just any eight countries of over 200  
countries of the United Nations; they hold 46.6 % of the world’s population. Asia as  
a whole has 90 % of the world’s rice area. Comparatively, Africa has only 8 M ha  
(5 %) (IRRI 2006), Latin America and the Caribbean have about 5.5 M ha (Pulver  
et al. 2010), and Brazil has about 2.8 M ha (Lafranco 2010). However, the growth  
rate in rice area during 1980–2011 has been 3.1 % pa in Africa as compared to only  
0.4 % pa in Asia (Adjao and Staatz  2015). Considering the total rice production,  
China had the largest share of 30.1 % in 2010, which is likely to decrease to 27.3 %  
by 2021–2022, while India’s share may slightly increase from 21.5 % in 2010 to  
22.4 % in 2021–2022 (Wailes and Chavez 2012). Asia’s share of world’s rice pro- 
duction may slightly decline from 89.9 to 89.3 % over 2010–2021, while Africa’s  
share may increase from 3.4 to 4.2 % (Wailes and Chavez 2012). 

1.4       Milestones in the Development of Modern Rice Varieties 

1.4.1       Indica–Japonica Crosses  

As a sequel to the recommendations of the International Rice Commission (IRC)  
Working Group, an indica × japonica  hybridization program was initiated in 1951  
under the auspices of FAO, United Nations. All the countries of tropical Asia par- 
ticipated in the project by sending the seeds of their best indica varieties for crossing  
with japonicas at the Central Rice Research Institute (CRRI), Cuttack, India. India  
and Malaysia distributed early-maturing, nonseasonal commercial varieties derived  
from this project. In India, ADT 27, which was suitable for the early monsoonal  
season, replaced the earlier varieties ADT 3 and ADT 4 in the Thanjavur delta. In  
Malaysia, Malinja and Mahsuri had the preferred grain quality and were recom- 
mended for the irrigated areas in Wellesley province (Parthasarathy  1972). Even  
today, Mahsuri is widely grown in many parts of tropical Asia, where there is poor  
soil and poor water control in the monsoonal season (DeDatta 1981).

1.4.2       High-Yielding Fertilizer Responsive Varieties  

In 1949, Dee-geo-woo-gen, a semidwarf rice variety, was crossed with Tsai-yuan-  
chung, a tall disease-resistant variety, and Taichung Native 1 was selected from this  
cross and released for cultivation in 1956. This was the first semidwarf, non- lodging,  
high-yielding variety which had a yield potential of 6 t ha−1. Later IRRI released  

IR-8 (Dee-geo-woo-gen × Peta, an Indonesian variety) in 1966, which also yielded  
6 t ha−1 or more. These high-yielding indica varieties spread in Southeast Asia and  

brought  the  Rice  Revolution.  Since  then,  IRRI  has  released  a  number  of  high-  
yielding varieties. 

1.4.2.1       Hybrid Rice 

Chinese rice breeder Yuan Longping, who is known as the father of hybrid rice, suc- 
cessfully transferred the male sterility gene from wild rice to create the cytoplasmic  
genetic male sterile (CMS) line and developed hybrid rice (Virmani et al.  1997).  
Hybrid rice yield is reported to be as high as 13.9 t ha−1 (Anonymous 2011). Hybrid  

rice is now grown in many South Asian countries, and in China it covers more than  
50 % area under rice (FAO 2004). 

1.4.2.2       Basmati Rice 

Basmati is an aromatic rice variety. The earliest mention of basmati rice was done  
by a poet Waris Shah in his authored poetic love story Heer Ranjha in 1766 (Singh  
2000; Robinson 2010). Basmati rice is famous for making pulao, a delicacy in India,  
Pakistan, and the Middle East and even in parts of the UK, the USA, and Canada,  
where large Indian and Pakistani communities reside. The aroma in basmati rice is  
due to a compound named 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline (Wongpornchai et al.  2003). The  
region for origin of basmati rice is Punjab (both in India and Pakistan), and the earli- 
est basmati rice variety Basmati 370 was released for commercial cultivation from  
Rice Research Station, Kala Shah Kaku (now in Pakistan), in 1933 (Singh 2000).  
Since yields of traditional basmati varieties were low (1 to 2.5 t ha−1) and the crop  

used to get lodged on heavy fertilization, plant breeders at the Indian Agricultural  
Research  Institute,  New  Delhi,  India,  crossed  traditional  basmati  varieties  with  
semidwarf high-yielding varieties and developed high-yielding (4–6 t ha−1) basmati  

varieties. The first such variety was Pusa Basmati 1. One of the most popular bas- 
mati varieties is Pusa Basmati 1121, which has a kernel length of 8.2 mm and an  
elongation ratio of 2.0 to 2.5 on cooking (Anonymous  2007). It was released for  
commercial cultivation in 2003, and by 2013 it covered 84 % of the total basmati  
area in Punjab, 78 % in Uttar Pradesh, 68 % in Haryana, and 38 % in Uttarakhand  
states. One of the latest additions is Pusa Basmati 1509. Work on the development  
of high-yielding varieties of basmati rice has also been conducted in Pakistan. The  
basmati rice varieties released in Pakistan include C-622, Basmati Pak (or Kernal

Basmati),  Basmati  198,  Basmati  370,  Pak  177,  Basmati  385,  Shaheen  Basmati,  
Basmati 2000, Super Basmati and Basmati 515, and PK-386 (Zafar 2015). Shaheen  
Basmati is more tolerant to salt-affected soils than other varieties, Basmati 2000 has  
better threshing characteristics, and Basmati 515 has a higher-yield potential than  
other varieties. Despite being released in 1996, Super Basmati is still widely grown  
in Pakistan (nearly 80–90 % of area under rice). In the USA, aromatic rice variety  
Texmati was developed by Rice Tec Inc., Alvin, Texas. 

1.4.2.3     Genetically Modified Rice 

One of the genetically modified (GM) rice is “golden rice.” Golden rice has been  
engineered  to  express  beta-carotene  by  introducing  a  combination  of  genes  that  
code for biosynthesis pathway for the production of provitamin A in the endosperm  
(Ye  et  al.  2000).  Enhancement  of  Fe  content  in  rice  has  also  been  achieved  by  
improving the uptake from soil and by increasing the absorption and storage of Fe  
(Murray-Kolb et al. 2002; Takahashi et al. 2001). Further, GM rice has been devel- 
oped that produces both beta-carotene and ferritin (Potrykus et al. 1996). However,  
golden rice has been a point of controversy. There are problems in the acceptance of  
GM crops in several countries (Jaffe 2005). 
    Herbicide-resistant (HR) rice is another group among GM rice. So far three types  
of HR rice have been developed. Glyphosate- and glufosinate-resistant ones are GM  
rice,  whereas  imidazolinone-resistant  rice  was  developed  through  chemically  
induced seed mutagenesis and conventional breeding (Gealy et al. 2003). HR rice  
are widely grown in the USA. However, there is a potential risk of transfer of the  
genes conferring HR traits to wild and weedy species (Kumar et al. 2008). Recently,  
Burgos et al. (2014) from the USA have reported that continuous growing of HR  
Clearfield (nontransgenic HR) rice has led to the evolution of HR weeds, which tend  
to possess crop halophytes in the portion of chromosome 2 containing the acetolac- 
tate synthase gene which confers herbicide resistance to Clearfield rice. 

1.4.2.4     NERICA Rice 

Oryza glaberrima was domesticated in Africa about 3500 years ago. It was prone to  
lodging and its panicles had shattering problem. To overcome these problems,  O.  
sativa was introduced in Africa some 450 years ago. Oryza sativa gave higher yields  
and has spread steadily in Africa. However, some O. glaberrima varieties, such as  
CG 14, are more weed competitive and resistant to iron toxicity, drought, nema- 
todes,  waterlogging,  and  major African  rice  diseases  and  pests. They  also  adapt  
better to acid soils and to soils low in phosphorus (P). Efforts are therefore under- 
way to develop crosses between O. glaberrima and O. sativa since the 1990s. These  
new rice types are known as NERICA (New Rice for Africa). The best NERICA  
varieties combine the stress tolerance of O. glaberrima and high-yield potential of  
O. sativa (Mohapatra, 2010).

1.4.2.5     Aerobic Rice 

Aerobic  rice  varieties  (ARVs)  were  developed  to  permit  growing  of  rice  as  an  
upland crop, such as wheat (Prasad 2011). In China, the breeding program for aero- 
bic rice was initiated in the 1980s at the China Agricultural University (CAU), the  
China Academy of Agricultural Sciences (CAAS), the Liaoning Province Academy  
of  Agricultural  Sciences  (LPAAS),  and  the  Dandong  Academy  of  Agricultural  
Sciences (DAAS). This led to the development of Han Dao (HD)297, HD277, and  
HD502. In addition, LPAA released Han 58 and DAAS released Danjing 5. These  
new varieties have more drought tolerance, reduced plant height, higher lodging  
resistance, erect upper leaves, and increased resistance to blast, higher grain yield,  
and better grain quality. The HD277 and H58 are currently the most extensively  
grown ARVs in China (Huaqi et al. 2002). 
   In Brazil, the National Research Center for Rice and Beans has developed many  
ARVs.  Maravilha  and  Primavera  were  the  first  upland  rice  varieties,  released  in  
1996,  that  combined  the  grain  quality  and  desirable  aerobic  rice  characteristics  
(Pinheiro 1999). Recently released ARVs are Talento and Soberana (Pinheiro et al.  
2006) and AN Cambara (Santana 2010). 
   IRRI initiated its own program for developing ARVs with a focus on tropical  
and subtropical regions and developed IR55423-01 (named Apo) and UPLRI-5  
from  the  Philippines,  B6144-MR-6-0-0  from  Indonesia,  and  CT6510-24-1-2  
from Columbia. Yields obtained with ARVs vary from 4.5 to 6.5 tha−1, which is  

about the double or triple of that obtained with traditional upland varieties and  
20–30 % less than that obtained with lowland varieties grown under flooded con- 
ditions (Farooq et al.  2009). Aerobic rice helps in doubling the water use effi- 
ciency, and there is 50 % water saving relative to the conventional lowland rice  
(Zhao et al. 2010). 

1.5      Rice Ecosystems 

Rice is grown under a wide variety of environments. The IRRI (IRRI  1993) has  
categorized rice field ecosystems (RFES) into four types: upland, irrigated, rainfed  
lowland, and flood-prone rice ecosystems (Fig.  1.1). The upland RFES varies from  
low-lying valleys to undulating and steep sloping land with high runoff and lateral  
water movement and covers less than 13 % of the world’s rice land. In the irrigated  
RFES,  the  rice  fields  have  assured  water  supply  for  one  or  more  crops  a  year.  
Irrigated lands cover about half of the world’s rice lands and produce about 75 % of  
the world’s rice. The rainfed lowland RFES has both flooding and drought prob- 
lems. About one quarter of the world’s rice fields are rainfed lowlands. The remain- 
ing rice fields are classified as flood-prone RFES and cover about 8 % of the world  
rice area. This RFES is subjected to uncontrolled flooding. The land may remain  
submerged for as long as 5 months at a time with water depth from 0.5 to 4.0 m or  
more, and in some areas there could be even intermittent flooding with brackish

ent problems, weed species, and pest problems and demand different rice crop man- 
agement strategies. 

1.6        Rice Soils 

The wide ranges of environmental conditions lead to an equally wide variety of rice  
soils. Moorman (1978) observed that the most important soil suborders on which  
rice is grown are Aquents, Aquepts, Orchepts, Tropepts, Aqualfs, and Aquults. As  
regards texture, rice is grown on loamy sands to heavy clay loams or clays. It is  
grown on acid soils below pH 5 to sodic soils having pH above 9. Again the rice  
soils may have organic matter contents of less than 1 % in loamy sands to peat soils  
having organic matter content as high as 95 %. Flooding changes the entire chemis- 
try of soils. The submergence leads to gradual depletion of oxygen in the soil, and  
this causes reduction of a number of nutrient ions such as nitrates, sulfates, iron,

manganese, etc. (Patrick and Mahapatra 1968). A number of chemical reactions fol- 
low submergence, which affect rice plant growth. Some of these are briefly dis- 
cussed here. 

1.6.1       Redox Potential  

The  single  electrochemical  property  that  serves  to  distinguish  a  submerged  soil  
from a well-drained soil is the reduction of oxygen, which is measured by its redox  
potential. The low potentials (0.2 to −0.4 V) of submerged soils reflect this reduced  
state as a contrast to the high potentials (0.8 to 0.3 V) of aerobic soils (Ponnamperuma  
1972). Iron, manganese, and sulfur availability is most affected by the changes in  
redox potential. 

1.6.2        Soil pH 

The overall effect of soil submergence is to increase the pH of acid soils and to  
depress the pH of sodic and calcareous soils, the ultimate result being convergence  
to pH 7.0 (Ponnamperuma 1972) (Fig. 1.2). This permits the rice plants to grow well  
on acid as well as alkaline soils too. You may consult Ponnamperuma (1972) for  
further information regarding the characteristics of submerged soils. 

1.6.3       Iron  

Under submerged conditions Fe3+ is reduced to Fe2+ . The relationship between Fe2+  

and pH is given by the expression (Ponnamperuma 1972) 

                                          pFe2+   = 2pH -10.8 
                                                                      

    According to the above expression, the activity of Fe2+ is likely to be 3.5 ppm at  

pH 7.5, 35 ppm at pH 7.0, 350 ppm at pH 6.5, and 3500 ppm at pH 6.0. Thus, a pH  
change of 0.5 units above or below pH 7.0 can spell the difference between defi- 
ciency and toxicity of iron in submerged soils. Iron toxicity leads to bronzing dis- 
ease indicated by brown spots on the leaves, which may coalesce to cover the entire  
leaf (Becker and Asch 2005). This is due to accumulation of oxidized polyphenols  
(Dobermann and Fairhurst 2000). Such leaves contain 300 to 1000 μg Fe2+ g−1 dry  

matter  (Ottow  et  al.   1983).  Iron  toxicity  prone  areas  include  poorly  drained  
Acquents, Acquepts,  and Acquults  in  Indonesia,  the  Philippines,  and  Sri  Lanka

(Jagsujinda and Patrick  1993); acid sulfate and peat soils of Brundi, Senegl, and  
Madagascar (Genon et al. 1994); lowlands of Western Africa (Audebert et al. 2006);  
and  flooded  soils  of  Assam  and  northeast  region  of  India  (Singh  et  al.  2003).  
Drainage and liming help in overcoming iron deficiency (Prasad 2000). 

1.6.4      Manganese  

Reduced conditions in submerged rice fields also lead to reduction of Mn4+ to  
Mn2+ . In the soils which are rich in manganese and organic carbon, Mn2+ con- 

centration can go as high as 90 ppm within a week or two after submergence  
followed  by  subsequent  decline  to  a  stable  level  of  10  ppm  (Ponnamperuma  
1972). This leads to manganese toxicity in rice, which generally occurs in con- 
currence with iron deficiency (Prasad 2007). Potassium (K) fertilization (Alam  
et al. 2003) and Si application (Li et al. 2012) can ameliorate manganese defi- 
ciency in rice. 

1.6.5        Sulfur 

Under submergence, sulfate is reduced to sulfide (S2−), and in iron-deficient soils,  

H S (hydrogen sulfide) is produced, which is toxic to rice (Tanaka et al. 1968; Joshi 2 
et al.  1975; Armstrong and Armstrong 2005). It damages rice roots, which become  
sparse, have reduced laterals, and turn black, and the disease is known as “Akiochi”  
in  Japan.  Hydrogen  sulfide  production  under  submerged  conditions  adversely

affects not only rice but also acts as a host of other plant species and organisms  
(Lamers et al. 2013). When sufficient iron is present, FeS is formed and gets pre- 
cipitated. Submergence can therefore lead to sulfur deficiency in rice (Yamaguchi  
1999). 
   Effects  of  submergence  on  N,  P,  K,  and  Zn  are  discussed  under  nutrient  
management. 

1.7      Cropping Systems (CS) 

In tropical regions, one, two, or three crops of rice are taken depending upon the  
rainfall and availability of irrigation water. In subtropical, subtemperate, and tem- 
perate regions, upland crops, such as beans, corn, wheat, and vegetables, are grown  
before or after rice. Beans and fodder legumes, such as clovers, and legume green  
manures such as Sesbania aculeata improve soil fertility (George and Prasad  1989;  
John  et  al.  1989;  Sharma  and  Prasad  1999).  Of  great  interest  is  the  rice–wheat  
(Triticum aestivum) cropping system (RWCS) practiced over 18.5 million hectares  
in South Asia and Southeast Asia (Prasad  2005; Ladha et al. 2009). In the Indian  
subcontinent,  rice  is  grown  during  rainy  season  (July  to  November)  when  700– 
1000  mm  rainfall  is  received,  while  wheat  is  grown  during  the  winter  season  
(November to May) on stored soil moisture with supportive irrigation. In China, rice  
and wheat have several common months, and quite a bit of rain is received during  
the wheat growing season. Many farmers in India and Pakistan take a third crop of  
potato  (Solanum  tuberosum)  or  toria  (Brassica  campestris)  in  between  rice  and  
wheat. Also,  many  farmers  cultivate  mung  bean  (Vigna  radiata)/cowpea  (Vigna  
unguiculata)/green manure in between wheat and rice. Some of the rice-based crop- 
ping  systems  are  rice–wheat,  rice–potato–wheat,  rice–toria–wheat,  rice–wheat– 
mung     bean,   rice–wheat–cowpea,       rice–wheat–green      manure     (Sesbania    spp.,  
Crotalaria     spp.),   rice–potato–wheat–green         manure,     rice–wheat–sunflower  
(Helianthus annuus), rice–wheat–rice, rice–vegetable peas (Pisum sativum)–wheat,  
rice–vegetable  peas–wheat–green  manure,  and  rice–wheat–maize  (Zea  mays).  
There could be many more variants involving vegetables and other short-duration  
crops. 
   The major problem of the RWCS is that rice is transplanted on a puddled soil in  
the rice production system called “conventional tillage with typical puddled trans- 
planted rice” (CTTPR), which has to be dried and given primary tillage for a soft  
seedbed for wheat. This delays seeding of wheat resulting in serious yield losses.  
Also repeated puddling adversely affects soil physical properties by destroying soil  
aggregates,  reducing  permeability  in  subsurface  layers,  and  forming  hardpans  at  
shallow depths (Sharma et al. 2003, 2004), all of which can negatively affect the  
following wheat crop (Tripathi et al.  2005). To avoid the delay in sowing wheat,  
no- till direct seeding technology has been developed, which has been very success- 
ful (Kumar and Ladha 2011).

1.8       Constraints to Sustained Rice Production 

The productivity and sustainability of rice and rice-based systems are threatened  
because of (1) increasing scarcity of resources (land, water, and labor and machines),  
(2) inefficient use of inputs (fertilizer, water, herbicides, insecticides, etc.), and (3)  
the rising cost of cultivation. 

1.8.1      Natural Resources  

1.8.1.1      Land 

Rice farm holdings in Asia are quite small, and arable land available per person is  
already too little compared to developed countries like the USA (Table 1.3). Further,  
more and more land is being diverted to roads, railways, and dwellings indicating a  
decline in arable land. Thus, the only hope for continued sustainable rice production  
is in increasing productivity per hectare. 

1.8.1.2      Water 

Rice  growers  in Asia  are  small  holder  farmers  who  are  always  on  the  mercy  of  
nature. Tuong and Bouman (2003) reported that seasonal water input for TPR varies  
from 660 to 5280 mm depending on growing season, climatic conditions, soil type,  
and hydrological conditions. This consists of (1) 160–1580 mm for land preparation  
(puddling),  400–700  mm  for  evapotranspiration  (ET),  and  1500–3000  mm  (for  
loamy/sandy soils) or 100–500 mm (for heavy soils) of unavoidable losses due to  
percolation and seepage. Gupta et al. (2002) estimated that water use for rice in the  
Indo-Gangetic Plains varied from 1144 mm in Bihar (wetter region) to 1560 mm in  
Haryana  (drier  region).  In  the  Philippines,  water  use  has  been  reported  as  790– 
1430 mm (aerobic fields) or 1240–1880 mm (flooded fields) (Bouman et al. 2005).  
In Pakistan, water input was 2190–2445 mm for flooded rice, 1793–1935 mm for  
alternate  wetting  and  drying,  and  1573–1635  mm  for  direct-seeded  rice  (Jabran  
et al. 2015a, b). The higher water application in rice as compared to other cereals is  
mostly due to water requirements for puddling and losses associated with continu- 
ous flooding such as seepage and deep percolation losses to groundwater (Hafeez  
et al. 2007). Seepage and percolation losses vary from 25 % to 85 % of total water  
input depending on soil type and water table and 25–50 % in heavy soils with shal- 
low water tables and 50–85 % in coarse-textured soil. 
    Total seasonal water input to rice fields varies from as little as 400 mm in heavy  
clay soils with shallow groundwater tables to more than 2000 mm in coarse- textured  
(sandy or loamy) soils with deep groundwater tables. Thus, on average about 1300– 
1500 mm of water is needed for irrigated rice in Asia. On an average, it takes 1432

liters of water to produce 1 kg of rice in an irrigated lowland production system  
(http://www.knowledgebank.irri.org/step-by-step-production/growth/ 
water-management). 
    Irrigated rice receives an estimated 34–43 % of the total world’s irrigation  
water  or  about  24–30  %  of  the  entire  world’s  developed  freshwater  resources  
(RKB 2015). Due to increase in area under irrigated rice, the use of groundwater  
structures (mostly irrigation pumps) and use of groundwater in Asia have consid- 
erably  increased  (Table  1.4). Thus,  irrigated  rice  has  resulted  in  lowering  the  
water  table,  and  in  some  regions  this  has  reached  an  alarming  situation.  For  
example, in North China Plain (NCP), water table is declining by 1–3 m each  
year (Shah et al.  2000), while in the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) of India, it is  
declining by 0.5–0.7 m each year (Carriger and Vallee 2007; Tuong and Bouman  
2003). 
    Increasing water scarcity has threatened the productivity and sustainability of the  
irrigated rice system in Asia (Tuong et al. 2004). Irrigation water is becoming scarce  
each day, and according to World Economic Forum (WEF 2011) of UNEP, several  
rice-growing Asian countries are likely to face 20–40 % (average 30 %) shortage in  
water availability by 2025 (Fig.  1.3). 
    In response to water shortage, researchers have made efforts to grow rice with  
less water inputs. These include the technologies such as alternate wetting and dry- 
ing, aerobic rice cultivation, dry direct-seeded rice, and rice cultivation using drip  
irrigation. For details, please see the chapter “Rice Production Methods.”

1.8.1.3      Labor 

In Asia, where most rice cultivation operations such as nursery raising, transplant- 
ing, weeding, and even harvesting are still done manually, the labor requirements  
are very high for CTTPR and are reported to be 237 person-days ha−1 in Malaysia  
(Wong and Moorka 1996), 229 person-days ha−1 in India (Thakur et al. 2004), and  
139 person-days ha−1 in Bangladesh (Rahman et al. (2008). Labor availability for  

agriculture is declining globally, and rice, which is a very labor-intensive crop, is  
going to suffer the most. Worldwide 60 % of all child labor in the age group of 5  
to 17 works in agriculture including farming, fisheries, aquaculture, forestry, and  
livestock, mostly as unpaid family members (ILO 2010). Further, wages for farm  
workers  in  South  and  Southeast Asia  have  increased;  the  average  wage  in  the  
2010s is five times higher than that in the 1970s, and an increase of 100 to 200 %  
in the current labor wages is a realistic expectation within the next 5–10 years

(Beltran et al. 2012). The mass rural-to-urban movement of young working class  
and resulting high wages of farm labor will eventually lead to mechanization of  
rice cultivation in Asia. 

1.8.2      Inputs  

1.8.2.1      Energy: Mechanization of Rice Cultivation 

Energy is required for all field operations in rice culture. The major advantage with  
machines is precision and saving of time. For each ton of rice produced, more than  
7000 mega joules (MJ) of energy are needed, whether provided by humans, ani- 
mals,  or  machines  (Rickman  2012).  For  instance,  manual  plowing  of  a  hectare  
requires 150 person-days, 12 days when animals are used, a day with a two-wheel  
tractor, and only 1–2 hours with a four-wheel tractor; the same amount of energy of  
about 1500 mega joules is required to do the job. The major difference is the time  
saved (Rickman 2012). Similar is the situation with transplanting. In one study, the  
mechanical transplanting of rice proved beneficial in saving of 66 % cost of trans- 
planting  and  required  only  7  %  of  time  as  compared  with  manual  transplanting  
(Sharma et al. 2002a, b). Moreover, it is seen that population of the plants in the  
farmers’ field is generally low (18–20 plants m−2) because the hired labor tends to  

transplant more area in a limited time for higher earnings, but it results in reduced  
grain yields. Aggarwal and Singh (2015) opined that mechanical transplanting is a  
promising solution to avoid yield reduction, as it helps in avoiding delay in trans- 
planting   under   labor-scarce   conditions   particularly   in   Indo-Gangetic   plains.  
Similarly, the cost of rice cultivation by drum seeding was reduced by 26 % because  
of mechanized paddy cultivation, and net return per acre also increased by 34 %  
(Malleswara Rao et al. 2014). As regards harvesting, manual harvesting and thresh- 
ing cost $100–120 per hectare, while manual harvesting with mechanical threshing  
costs about $80 per hectare, which is similar to combine harvesting that costs $80– 
100 per hectare (Rickman 2012). Moreover, grain losses due to shattering are much  
less from rice combine harvesters compared with the manual harvesting. Rice com- 
bine harvesters are expensive and relatively sophisticated machines. Small holder  
farmers obviously cannot afford to buy or maintain these machines. Availability of  
combine harvesters and other farm machinery on custom-hiring basis is the only  
solution and is already being practiced in some countries. 
    In countries like the USA, Brazil, and Japan, rice cultivation is completely mech- 
anized, while in developing countries it is fully manual or partially mechanized. The  
majority of US rice is typically planted with seed drills after preparatory cultivation  
involving several tillage and smoothing operations and basal fertilizer application.  
After or before seeding, levees are established using levee disks or squeezers, and  
gates and spills are established using vinyl and/or metal frames to permit mainte- 
nance of shallow 5–10 cm standing water throughout the growing season, and the

fields are drained 15–25 days after heading (Synder and Slaton 2001). In Sacramento  
Valley  in  California,  rice  seeding  is  done  by  airplanes  in  standing  water  (Souza  
2005). Using GPS (global positioning system) equipment, pilots are able to lay the  
seed exactly on target. Fertilizer and pesticide application all over the USA is done  
by airplanes, and harvesting is done by combine harvesters. In Brazil, all operations  
are done using tractor and other necessary equipment, while harvesting is done by  
combine harvesters (Fageria et al. 2014). In Japan, paddy rice production has been  
mechanized since the 1970s, and 90 % of rice transplanting is mechanized (Li et al.  
2005). Also in South Korea, 100 % of the tillage, 98 % of the transplanting, 100 %  
of the spraying, and 99 % of the harvesting of paddy rice production have been  
mechanized  (Park  and  Kim  2005).  In  Japan,  again  most  operations  are  done  by  
especially designed equipment including transplanters, hand-operated harvesters, or  
combine harvesters (Oshino 1985). In China, mechanization of rice cultivation is in  
progress (Xu et al. 2011). 

1.8.2.2     Fertilizer 

Nitrogen 

Rice crop uses about 21–25 % of the total N fertilizer consumed globally. However,  
the  N  use  efficiency  in  rice  is  very  low. Agronomic  efficiency  of  N  in  rice  was  
reported to be 13 kg grain kg−1 N from India (Prasad et al. 2000) and 10.4 kg grain  
kg−1 N from China (Zhang et al. 2007a). The low nitrogen use efficiency in rice and  

even in other crops is due to four N loss mechanisms, namely, surface runoff on  
sloping lands, ammonia volatilization, leaching, and denitrification (Zou et al. 2005;  
Towprayoon et al. 2005; Pathak et al. 2006; Ussiri and Lal 2012; Prasad et al. 2014;  
Prasad  and  Shivay  2015).  The  agronomic  techniques  employed  to  reduce  these  
losses include deep placement and split application of N supported by balanced and  
adequate application of other nutrients to boost crop growth (Prasad 2013). Another  
approach has been the use of nitrification inhibitors (Prasad and Power  1995), ure- 
ase inhibitors (Kiss and Simihian 2002), and slow-release N fertilizers (Prasad et al.  
1971; Trenkel  1997; Shaviv 2001). These materials have met with mixed success.  
The government of India has decided to coat all urea manufactured or imported in  
the country with neem (Azadirachta indica Juss) (Prasad and Shivay 2015). Neem- 
coated urea was developed by Prasad et al. ( 1994, 2007) at the Indian Agricultural  
Research  Institute,  New  Delhi,  and  is  based  on  the  mild  nitrification-inhibiting  
properties of neem (Reddy and Prasad  1975). 

Phosphorus 

As a contrast to N, which is available in infinite amounts in the atmosphere, P fertil- 
izers are made from phosphate rocks, which are a nonrenewable resource and are  
sufficient only for 1000 years or less, depending upon the processes used for their  

----------------------- Page 24-----------------------

1   Current Status, Challenges, and Opportunities in Rice Production                       17 

extraction and manufacture and the methods of their use on agricultural fields (Smil  
2002; Zhang et al. 2008). The global estimates of phosphate rock are at 67,000 bil- 
lon metric tons (BMT), and in Asia, only China has sizeable phosphate rock depos- 
its (3700 BMT) (van Kauwenbergh et al. 2013). 
   Although recovery efficiency of P by rice is about 15–30 %, the rest of P gets  
fixed in soil (Sample et al.  1986). Submergence of rice fields leads to a flush of  
available P in soil (Kirk et al.  1990); however, continued submergence can reverse  
this effect as P is precipitated in the oxidized rhizosphere and sorbed on the solid  
phases during reduction (Patrick and Mahapatra 1968). A well-planned integrated P  
management using organic manures, crop residues, and P-solubilizing microorgan- 
isms is therefore important (Blaise et al. 2014). In the RWCS, drying during wheat  
season reduces P availability (Kumar and Yadav 2001). Good response to P applica- 
tion has been reported from India (Prasad 2007; Singh et al. 2014), China (Zhu et al.  
2007; Bi et al. 2014; Guan et al. 2014), and Brazil (Fageria et al. 2014). Adequate P  
fertilization of rice is therefore necessary for sustained good yields of rice. 

Potassium 

Like P, K minerals are also a nonrenewable resource. The global deposits are esti- 
mated at 250 billion metric tons (BMT) (USGS 2008) with Canada having the larg- 
est deposits, followed by Russia. In Asia, only China has sizeable K mineral deposits,  
and in 2014/2015, it produced 5 MMT of potash fertilizers against its consumption  
of over 9 MMT (Tan 2015). Response of rice to K in China is much higher than in  
India. Zhang et al. (2010) observed that addition of 100 kg ha−1 to each rice crop in  

rice–rice rotation was not enough to maintain initial K availability in soil. Red and  
lateritic kaolinitic soils have less total K and non-exchangeable K than calcareous  
illitic and vertic smectitic soils and are therefore likely to need more K fertilization  
in rice (Sekhon et al. 1992). This would explain why response of rice to K fertilizers  
was more (9.7 kg grainkg−1 K) in Western Ghats and Karnataka Plateau having red  

and lateritic soil than in north Indian alluvial plains having calcareous illitic soils  
(Tandon and Sekhon  1988). Tiwari (2014) estimated that a harvest of 200 MMT of  
food grains per year will lead to a deficit of 5.8 million metric tons of K from the soil,  
which has to be replenished. Thus, adequate K fertilization of rice is important. 

Zinc 

Nene ( 1966) was the first to report that Khaira disease of rice (brown/maroon color- 
ing of leaves) that was due to zinc (Zn) deficiency. Good response of rice to zinc  
fertilization is reported from all over the world (Alloway 2008). Further, Zn defi- 
ciency in soils is also linked with low Zn concentrations in grains of cereals includ- 
ing rice. Therefore, efforts are underway to develop GM rice with grains having  
higher concentration of Zn (Stein 2010) as well toward agronomic biofortification  
of rice with Zn (Prasad et al. 2014).

1.8.2.3     Pesticides 

It is estimated that about 120–200 MMT of rice grain is lost in tropical Asia due to  
insects, diseases, and weeds (Gianessi  2014). Conventional rice-growing regions  
are  humid  to  subhumid,  and  there  are  a  large  number  of  diseases  such  as  blast,  
brown leaf spot, sheath blight, bacterial blight, tungro virus, and grassy stunt virus  
(Hollier  et  al.  1993).  Blast  epidemics  in  Malaysia  and  the  Philippines  caused  a  
50–70  %  yield  reduction  (Gianessi  2014).  Similarly,  the  damage  due  to  sheath  
blight caused a loss of 17–25 % in Malaysia (Banniza and Holderness 2001), 10 %  
in India, and 20 % in Thailand (Boukaew and Prasertan 2014). It is difficult to breed  
rice varieties with high genetic resistance to these diseases; however, the develop- 
ment of multiple resistances for diseases and insect pests is the only solution to the  
problem (Singh et al.  2012; Suh et al. 2013). Details have been discussed in the  
chapter “Disease Management in Rice.” 
    Similarly, there are a large number of insect pests that attack the rice crop. Some  
important ones are brown plant hopper, white-backed plant hopper, green leaf hop- 
per, rice mealy bug, rice aphid, rice leaf folder, rice swarming caterpillar, rice gall  
midge, and rice gundhi bug (Pathak and Khan  1994). Stem borers alone can cause  
yield losses up to 70 % in an epidemic year (Rahim et al.  1992). Insecticide sale in  
South and Southeast Asia increased from US$ 409 million in 2009 to US$ 674 mil- 
lion in 2012 (Gianessi 2014). Current emphasis is on integrated pest management  
(IPM)  (Oudejans  1999).  Details  have  been  discussed  in  the  chapter  “Insect  Pest  
Management in Rice.” 
    Weed management using herbicides has become an integral part of modern crop  
production including rice. Herbicides offer great flexibility of operations, are effec- 
tive,  and  are  often  cost  effective  as  compared  to  any  other  method  of  weed  
 management (Chauhan et al. 2012). In rice, weeds can cause 28–74 % loss in yield  
(Chauhan 2012). Nevertheless, injudicious and continuous use of a single herbicide  
over a long period of time may result in the evolution of resistant biotypes and a  
shift in the weed flora. For example, spread of herbicide-resistant weedy rice (red  
rice, Oryza sativa L.) has been reported from Italy (Busconi et al. 2012). California  
rice farmers are already facing the challenge of managing herbicide-resistant weeds  
(Lindquist et al. 2011). A large list of biotypes showing resistance to herbicides in  
the USA is available (Vencill et al. 2012). Details have been discussed in the chapter  
“Weed Management in Rice.” 

1.8.3       Global Warming (GW) and Rice Production 

Global warming (GW) in relation to rice cultivation has to be viewed from two  
angles: (1) impact of GW on future rice production and (2) contribution of rice cul- 
tivation to GW. 

----------------------- Page 26-----------------------

1   Current Status, Challenges, and Opportunities in Rice Production                               19 

1.8.3.1     Impact of Global Warming on Rice Production 

In a simulation study, a 2 C increase in temperature brought about a 3–10 % decrease  
                              ° 

in grain/seed yield of rainy season crops, such as rice, groundnut (Arachis hypogaea  
L.), and soybean (Glycine max L.), and a 29 % decrease in grain yield of winter  
crops such as wheat (Prabhjyot-Kaur and Hundal  2006). In addition to the direct  
effects of climate change on rice plants, Chauhan and Johnson (2010a, b, c) and  
Chauhan et al. (2014) pointed out that increased weed growth and changed weed  
flora could adversely affect rice growth and production. Many weeds are C  plants 4 
and have a competitive advantage over rice, a C  plant (Yin and Struik 2008).3 
    There  are  two  major  abiotic  stresses  that  can  affect  rice  production,  namely,  
drought and salinity. Analysis of models based on soil moisture changes, drought  
indices, and precipitation minus evaporation suggests increased risk of drought in  
the  next  30–90  years  over  many  land  areas  either  by  decreased  precipitation  or  
increased evaporation (Dai  2013). However, Trenbath et al. (2014) observed that  
increased heating due to global warming may cause droughts to set in earlier than  
predicted. Wassman et al. (2009) observed that current temperatures are already  
approaching critical levels during the susceptible stages of the rice plant in Pakistan/ 
north  India  (during  October),  south  India  (during  April,  August),  east  India/ 
Bangladesh/Myanmar/Thailand/Laos/Cambodia   (during   March–June),  Vietnam  
(April/August), the Philippines (April/June), Indonesia (August), and China (dur- 
ing July/August) and drought stress is expected to affect rice growth and produc- 
tion. Wassmann and Dobermann (2007) observed that increasing temperatures or  
hotter  night  temperatures  can  cause  increased  spikelet  sterility  and  reduce  grain  
yield in rice. 
    Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC 2001) predicted that between  
1990 and 2100, sea level may rise by 9–88 cm in different regions of the world. This  
will affect rice production in mega-deltas in Vietnam, Myanmar, and Bangladesh  
(Wassmann et al. 2009). The other hot spot with especially high climate change risk  
is the Indo-Gangetic Plains (the rice–wheat copping system belt), which will be  
affected  by  the  melting  of  the  Himalayan  glaciers  (Wassmann  et  al.  2009).  
Developing rice production systems and production technology with higher resil- 
ience to flooding and salinity is the key for maintaining sustained rice production in  
these areas. 

1.8.3.2     Contribution of Rice Cultivation to Global Warming 

Under submerged rice paddy conditions, methane (CH ) is produced due to anaero-4 
bic conditions, while nitrous oxide (N O) is produced due to nitrification–denitrifi-2 
cation  processes  from  the  applied  fertilizer  N  both  under  aerobic  upland  and  
anaerobic lowland conditions. Both these gases contribute to GW. The global warm- 
ing potential (GWP) of methane is 72 times that of carbon dioxide (CO ) (which is 2

20                                                                                    R. Prasad et al. 

taken as 1.0) for a life span of 12 years. According to Sass et al. ( 1999), CH  emis-4 
sion is 13–17 Tg y−1 from China (Wang et al.  1994), 2.4–6.0 Tg y−1 from India  
(Parashar et al. 1994), 0.04–8.77 Tg y−1 from Japan (Yagi et al.  1994), 0.31–7.0 Tg  
y−1 from the Philippines (Neue and Saas  1994), and 0.328 Tg y−1 from the USA  

(Leip and Bocchi 2007). Of the total methane emission from a country, rice contrib- 
utes about 1.3 % in the USA, 3.7 % in Italy, 24 % in Japan, 30 % in China, and 35 %  
in India (Leip and Bocchi 2007). 
    Total CH  emission from the world is anticipated at 16–34 Tg y−1 and is consid- 
               4 

ered to be 63 % of total anthropogenic CH  emission in the world (Saas et al. 1994). 4 
However, IPCC ( 1996) estimated that the contribution of rice cultivation toward  
total  global  methane  emission  is  5–20  %.  Addition  of  rice  straw  to  rice  fields  
increases CH  emission (Sass et al.  1990; Rath et al. 1999). Midterm drainage dur-4 
ing  rice-growing period or alternate wetting and drying can substantially reduce  
CH  emission from rice fields, but it increases N O emission (Sanders et al. 2014; 4 2 
Pandey et al.  2014). Methane production is negligible under non-flooded aerobic  
conditions (Ramakrishna et al. 1995). However, there are uncertainties in estimating  
methane emission, and recently, Tian et al. (2015) using process-based couple bio- 
geochemical model estimated total methane CH  from global terrestrial ecosystems 4 
during 1981–2010 at 144.39 ±12.90 Tg C y−1; annual increasing trend was 0.43±0.06  
Tg  C  y−1.  The  most  rapid  increase  in  methane  emission  during  1981–2010  was  

found in natural wetlands and rice fields due to increased cultivation area and cli- 
mate warming (Tian et al. 2015). Sanders et al. (2014) observed that in rice fields  
CH  contributed about 90 % of the total GWP.4 
    The GWP of N O is 289 times that of CO  and its life span is 114 years. Thus its 2 2 
potential for GW is much higher than CH . However, the amounts of its emission 4 
are much smaller than CH . Tian et al. (2015) predicted global N O emission at 4    2 
12.52 ± 0.74 Tg N y−1, while Davidson and Kanter (2014) estimated it to be between  
10 and 12 Tg N y−1. Net anthropogenic N O emission is estimated at 5.3 Tg Ny−1,  
                                                    2 

out  of  which  66  %  is  predicted  from  agriculture  and  business-as-usual  emission  
scenarios project almost doubling of N O emissions by 2050 (Davidson and Kanter 2 
2014). The largest increase in N O emission during 1981–2010 occurred in upland 2 
crops due to increasing air temperature and N fertilizer use (Tian et al. 2015). 

1.9      Rice Cultivation and Environmental Pollution 

Fertilizers applied to rice contribute considerably toward environmental pollution.  
Only about one-third of the N fertilizer applied is taken up by the rice crop, while  
the rest two-thirds, except for a small fraction being immobilized by the soil organ- 
isms, is lost through ammonia volatilization, denitrification, and leaching and sur- 
face runoff; estimates for these losses are at 4.1 Tg, 3.1 Tg, and 3.1 Tg, respectively  
(Pathak 2013). While ammonia produced by volatilization and nitrous oxide pro- 
duced by denitrification are lost to the atmosphere, nitrates are leached down the

profile or move with surface runoff (Prasad and Shivay 2014) and are responsible  
for eutrophication of surface (lakes and estuaries) and groundwater. Similarly the  
recovery efficiency of P fertilizer applied to rice is only 15–30 %. 

1.9.1       Eutrophication of Surface and Groundwater  

An important current issue is the need to reduce anthropogenic nutrient inputs to  
aquatic ecosystems in order to protect drinking water supplies and to reduce eutro- 
phication of lakes and estuaries including the proliferation of “algal blooms” and  
“dead zones” in coastal marine ecosystems (Conley et al. 2009). Algal blooms lead  
to the depletion of dissolved oxygen in water (hypoxia), which can lead to fish mor- 
tality,  and  their  decomposition  impairs  such  waters  for  drinking,  recreation,  and  
industry  (Foy  2005).  Since  Schindler  (1974)  established  that  P  was  the  primary  
limiting nutrient for algal growth, national water policy in the USA, Canada, and  
Europe during the 1970s focused on P control in the lakes; however, in the last two  
decades, it has emerged that N is the main pollutant in the estuaries (Howarth and  
Marino 2006). Elevated levels of N and P have been reported from the three major  
lakes (Taihu, Chaohu, Dianchi) in China (Gao and Zhang 2010). Also there has been  
a threefold increase in nitrate concentration in the estuary of Yangtze River during  
the last 40 years, from 1.3 mg L−1 in the 1980s to 5.0 mg L−1 in 1999–2004 (Duan  

et al. 2000), and a 30 % increase in phosphate concentration during the same period  
from 0.056 mg L−1 in the 1980s to 0.73 mg L−1 in 1999–2004 (Zhou et al. 2008). Jin  

(1995) reported that up to 35 % of N and 68 % of P in surveyed lakes was from  
agricultural runoff. A good correlation between N concentration in river waters and  
N fertilizer applied in the catchment areas has been recorded (Chen et al.  2000).  
Duan et al. (2005) and Liu et al. (2007) observed that the risk of P loss from agri- 
cultural land is increasing. In Southern China, the leaching loss from rice fields  
varied  from  6.7  to  27.0  kg  N−1,  while  that  from  runoff  varied  from  2.5  to  
19.0 kg N ha−1 (Sun et al. 2003). Xia et al. (2008) reported that in rice, application  
of 0, 25, 60, 120, and 240 kg P ha−1 resulted in a loss of 0.13, 0.50, 0.94, 3.02, and  
5.97 kg P ha−1; thus, losses were proportionally higher as the rate of application  

increased.  Further  Zhang  et  al.  (2007b)  reported  that  losses  were  most  within  
1–2 months of application. 
    Due  to  nitrate  leaching  from  agricultural  fields,  over  half  of  the  groundwater  
samples in Northern China revealed nitrate concentration higher than 50 mg L−1, the  

World Health Organization (WHO) recommended safe level; even nitrate concen- 
tration higher than 300 mg L−1 was recorded in several samples (Dong et al. 2005).  

The situation in India is not that bad, and in studies in the rice–wheat cropping  
system belt in Punjab (Bharadwaj et al. 2012) as well as in the rice–rice cropping  
system region in Nalgonda district in Andhra Pradesh (Karthikeyan et al.  2012),  
about 72 % of samples of groundwater analyzed had less than 50 mg nitrate L−1, and  

water was safe for drinking. This is because general rates of N and P application in  

----------------------- Page 29-----------------------

22                                                                                          R. Prasad et al. 

China are 150–200 kg N and 22–30 kg P ha−1 (Jin et al. 2002), while those in India  
are only 86–163 kg N and 4.4–25.8 kg P ha−1 (Sharma et al.  2010). However, in  

China efforts are being made to determine ecologically optimum rather than the  
conventional economic optimum rates of N for rice (Xia and Yan 2012). This would  
lead to reduced N application in rice. 

1.9.2       Depletion of Ozone Layer  

Ozone in the stratosphere of the earth’s atmosphere works as a bio-protective filter  
against ultraviolet (UV) radiation, which can cause skin cancer (Narayanan et al.  
2010) and cataract in eyes (Roberts  2011) of the humans. Ultraviolet radiation is  
also  reported  to  adversely  affect  plant  growth  (Hollosy  2002;  Zuk-Golaszewska  
et  al.  2003).  Nitrous  oxide  (N O)  is  a  major  cause  of  ozone  layer  depletion 2 
(Ravishankara et al. 2009), and about two-thirds of N O is produced by nitrifica-2 
tion–denitrification  reactions  in  agricultural  fields  from  the  applied  fertilizer  N  
(Zumft 1997; Lassey and Harvey 2007; Thomson et al. 2011). Rice cultivation due  
to changes in redox potential caused by submergence has therefore a role in the  
destruction of ozone layer in the stratosphere. 

1.10        Summary and Conclusions 

Rice is the staple food for nearly half of the world’s population which makes it a  
crop of focus. As rice is grown on a variety of soils under diverse ecological condi- 
tions in all the six inhabited continents of the world, hence diverse and site-specific  
production technologies are required rather than a single production technology.  
Compared with the past (1962–1979; rice yield growth rate 2.5 %), the growth rate  
of  rice  yields  per  annum  has  been  declined  (1980–2011;  rice  yield  growth  rate  
1.4 %). 
    Natural resources, land, water, and labor are becoming scarcer worldwide, and  
rice is going to suffer the most, because with the present production technologies,  
its water and labor requirements are the highest among field crops. In this back- 
drop, the rice production technologies with lower labor and water input hold sig- 
nificance.  Growing  rice  under  water-saving  production  systems  and  adoption  of  
mechanization in developing countries are important in this regard. However, prac- 
tical  and  social  constraints  in  the  way  of  such  developments  are  desired  to  be  
resolved using current knowledge, research, and available resources. For example,  
weed infestation is an important issue of aerobic rice cultivation, while high finan- 
cial requirement is a constraint in the installment of drip irrigation infrastructures  
in the rice production systems. Such issues are desired to be resolved for sustain- 
able rice production. Other salient research issues in the rice production include the

development of site-specific integrated nutrient management plans, addressing the  
environmental problems resulting from the overuse of N, and the development of  
integrated pest management plan.

Rice Production in China 

Lixiao Nie and Shaobing Peng 

2.1      Summary 

Rice is one of the prominent cereal crops in China, and about 65 % of Chinese  
people rely on rice. Nearly 95 % of the rice grown in China is produced under  
traditional puddled transplanted conditions in China with prolonged periods of  
flooding. However, several factors have threatened the sustainability and produc- 
tivity of traditional puddled transplanted rice production system, such as climate  
change, decline in rice planting area, scarcity of labor availability, narrow genetic  
background of rice varieties, overuse of fertilizers and chemicals, poor extension  
system, and oversimplified crop management. Chinese government and rice sci- 
entists put sincere efforts to cope with these constraints. New breeding techniques  
such as marker-assisted selection, transformation, and genetic engineering were  
adopted to increase yield potential. Synergy among fertilizer, water, and pest and  
weed management should be considered to maximize overall efficiency of the rice  
production  system.  Nowadays,  labor  shortage  in  rural  areas  is  the  major  con- 
straint to the flood- transplanted rice production in China, and the mechanization  
for rice production is the key to solve this problem. Direct seeding rice is a prom- 
ising planting technique in face of water and labor shortages in rice cultivation  
with advantages of less input requirement, more economic returns, and less meth- 
ane and CO  emissions.2

2.2      Introduction 

China is a leading rice-producing country in the world, contributing 28.7 % of the  
global rice production (FAOSTAT 2013). Rice is a major staple food in China and  
the subsistence crop for most of the resource-poor farmers and consumers in rural  
areas.  Rice  is  grown  in  almost  every  province  of  China  except  Qinghai.  Three-  
quarters of the total rice area is planted with indica rice varieties and the rest with  
japonica rice varieties. Indica rice varieties are generally grown in the south and  
japonicas  in  the  north.  During  the  past  decades,  China  became  self-sufficient  in  
basic food for the first time in modern history. Hybrid rice is one of the greatest  
innovations and miracles in the world, which contributed greatly to the food secu- 
rity in China in the past 30 years. Hybrid rice varieties occupy about 50 % of China’s  
total rice planting areas (Yuan 2003). 
    China ranks first in the world in total annual rice production (about 203.6 mil- 
lion tons in 2013). Despite the sufficient current rice production, an additional  
20 % increase in rice yield is still desired to meet the demands of the growing  
population by the 2020s (Peng et al. 2009). Land resources suitable for rice cul- 
tivation are currently limited in China; hence, improvement in the rice productiv- 
ity is necessary to meet the future food demands. However, available evidence  
indicates that increasing trends in the Chinese rice yields have slowed down in  
recent decades (Cassman et al. 2003; Peng et al. 2009; Ray et al. 2012). Yield gap  
analyses reveal that Chinese rice yields have been approaching their biophysical  
potential ceiling in recent years (Cassman et al. 2003; Lobell et al. 2009; Licker  
et al. 2010; Neumann et al. 2010; van Wart et al. 2013). Recently, a simulation  
model has indicated that the current average Chinese rice yield is approximately  
82 % of the national yield potential (van Wart et al. 2013). Reaching potential  
yield  ceiling  has  been  considered  as  the  yield  stagnation  (Cassman  1999;  van  
Wart et al. 2013). 
    China’s agricultural production is facing the global climate change, population  
increase, serious disease and insect damage, labor shortage, water scarcity, yield  
stagnation, and environmental pollution. All these factors are threatening the sus- 
tainability and productivity of rice production systems in China. 

2.3      History, Importance, Area, and Production 

More than 28 % of the total global rice is produced in China, and the stability of rice  
production in China plays an important role in the world’s food security (FAOSTAT  
2013). It is one of the prominent cereal crops in China as about 65 % of Chinese  
people rely on rice (Zhang et al. 2005). Rice was grown on 18 % of the total arable  
area of China, representing 34.6 % of the total Chinese grain production (FAOSTAT  
2013).  In  China,  nearly  95  %  of  the  rice  grown  is  produced  under  traditionally

2   Rice Production in China                                                              35 

puddled conditions subjected to transplanting with prolonged periods of flooding  
(Peng et al. 2009). 
   Rice production in China has increased more than three times over the past six  
decades due to vertical increase in grain yield per plant, per unit area rather than  
horizontal  expansion  of  area.  The  increase  in  grain  yield  has  resulted  from  the  
development of new varieties such as semidwarf varieties in the 1950s and hybrid  
rice varieties in the 1970s and from improved crop management practices such as  
nitrogen fertilization and irrigation (Peng et al. 2009). Since the 1990s, the adoption  
of hybrid rice varieties has been widely increased because of the heterosis from  
hybridization. The proportion of hybrid rice varieties to the total rice planting area  
was hovering around 60–65 %; however, the proportion has never exceeded 70 % in  
China (Mao et al. 2006). 
   Although rice production in China is distributed across temperate, subtropical,  
and tropical areas, most of the rice is produced in the subtropical areas. Based on  
the climate and cropping systems, rice production in China has been classified  
into  six  agroecological  zones  and  15  subzones  (China  National  Rice  Research  
Institute  1988). 

2.4     Rice-Based Cropping Systems 

Southern China is the main rice production area in China, accounting for 94 % of  
national rice planting area and 88 % of national rice production (Ma et al. 2013).  
The rice-based cropping systems in China are diverse due to a diversity in agrocli- 
matic zones. There are three major rice cropping patterns in China: single rice crop- 
ping per year, annual rice-upland crop rotations, and double rice cropping annually.  
Single rice cropping system is mainly located in Northern China, and it accounts for  
17 % of the total rice production in China (National Bureau of Statistics of China  
2011). Annual rice-upland crop rotation system (rice-wheat or rice-rapeseed rota- 
tion) is mainly located in Central China (in the provinces of Jiangsu, Anhui, Hubei,  
and  Sichuan  along  the Yangtze  River Valley),  and  it  accounts  for  49  %  of  total  
Chinese rice production (National Bureau of Statistics of China 2011). Double rice  
cropping system mainly located in South China accounts for 34 % of the total rice  
production in China (National Bureau of Statistics of China 2011). However, plant- 
ing area of double rice cropping in China has been decreasing continuously. The  
proportion of double rice cropping area to total rice production area has dropped  
from 71 % in 1970s to about 40 % at present (Bai 2013; Zhu et al. 2013). The main  
reasons for this decline are labor shortage, low degree of mechanization, and low  
production efficiency for double rice cropping. However, the planting area of single  
rice cropping system with japonica rice varieties in Northeast China has increased  
by 485 % because of the relative high comparative profits of rice production and the  
improvement  of  people’s  living  standards  (Xu  et  al.  2010;  National  Bureau  of  
Statistics of China 2011).

2.5      Varieties and Genetic Improvement 

Hybrid rice research was initiated by Prof. Yuan Longping in the1960s. In the 1970s,  
the  first  hybrid  combination  was  developed  with  good  heterosis  and  high  grain  
yield. Technology for large-scale hybrid seed production was  fully developed in  
1975. The release of hybrid rice for commercial production was started in 1976.  
Since then, China became the first country to adopt hybrid rice technology over a  
large production area (Ma and Yuan 2015). At present, hybrid rice cultivars occu- 
pied more than half of the total rice-growing area in China, including both three-line  
system and two-line system hybrid rice varieties (Virmani et al. 2003). In recent  
years, two-line hybrid varieties are grown in 3 million ha. It has been demonstrated  
that the two-line system hybrids provide 5–10 % higher yield than the three-line  
system hybrids (Ma and Yuan 2015). 
    The methods for rice breeding include both conventional breeding and molecular  
breeding. Conventional breeding selects genotypes indirectly through phenotypes  
which  are  generally  effective  for  qualitative  traits  but  not  for  quantitative  traits,  
while molecular breeding refers to the development of new rice varieties by integrat- 
ing the means of modern biotechnology into conventional breeding methods, which  
mainly involve marker-assisted selection and molecular breeding. The transforma- 
tion of rice breeding from conventional genetics to molecular design of new variet- 
ies is a general trend, which ensures the breeding of new varieties with improved  
agronomic traits in terms of the yield, grain quality, resource-use efficiency, disease  
and pest resistance, and stress tolerance. In recent years, great efforts have been  
made in rice genome sequencing, and there have been significant developments in  
functional genomics. A number of genes have been successfully transferred in mega  
rice varieties. Multiple chromosome segment substitution lines are constructed, and  
a large number of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) have been identified. 
    In  order  to  meet  the  food  requirement  of  China  in  the  twenty-first  century,  a  
super rice breeding program was launched in 1996 by the Ministry of Agriculture in  
China. Following the super rice breeding program, Prof. Yuan put forwarded the  
theory of super hybrid rice, emphasizing on the plant morphological improvement  
and utilization of the inter-subspecific heterosis. To increase rice production quanti- 
tatively and qualitatively in harmony with the environment, Zhang (2007) proposed  
strategies for developing Green Super Rice (GSR) in 2007. GSR should possess the  
following characteristics: adequate resistances to major diseases and insects, high  
efficiency in nutrient uptake and utilization, resistance to drought and other abiotic  
stresses,  good  quality,  and  increased  yield  potential.  The  general  strategy  is  to  
develop green super rice (GSR) by introducing and evaluating the rice germplasm  
resources originating from all over the world, developing the introgression popula- 
tions, and mapping the elite genes/QTLs with the molecular markers through the  
collaborative research of ten institutes in different ecological areas. After 10 years  
of struggle, a national molecular rice breeding network and a molecular breeding  
platform have been developed, and a series of new varieties with high yield potential  
and water-saving, disease, and insect resistance were developed.

2   Rice Production in China                                                             37 

   In recent years, great progress has been made on molecular breeding in rice, and  
the productivity per unit area has been significantly improved in China. More atten- 
tion has been given to the development and utilization of wild rice, because wild  
rice provides rich genetic resources with good traits such as strong pest resistance  
and stress tolerance. Furthermore, a great focus has been given for understanding  
the vital role of wide compatibility resources in rice heterosis. 

2.6     Rice Production Methods 

Rice planting methods in any specific area rely on the prevailing environment, eco- 
logical conditions, and the socioeconomic factors. Traditional rice planting technol- 
ogy based on artificial transplanting will no longer be able to meet the social and  
economic  requirements;  therefore,  it  is  inevitable  to  develop  cost-efficient  and  
labor-saving rice planting methods. Major rice planting methods include manual  
transplanting,  direct  seeding  (manual  and  mechanical  direct  seeding),  throwing  
transplanting, mechanical transplanting, and ratooning rice. Area of manual trans- 
planting is continuously declining due to the labor shortage in rural areas, and now  
manual transplanting is mainly limited to areas of relatively high population den- 
sity, low per capita arable land area, small-scale farming, and abundant labor force.  
Area of direct-seeded rice (DSR) has increased from 2 % in 2000 to about 11 % of  
the total rice area in 2009. Over the same period, mechanical transplanting increased  
from 2 % to about 13% of rice area (Zhang et al. 2012). 
   In Europe, America, and Australia, most of the rice was produced by direct seed- 
ing, whereas Japan and South Korea farmers mainly adopted mechanical transplant- 
ing  for  rice  cultivation  and  to  some  extent  mechanical  direct  seeding.  DSR  
technology has been proposed to reduce water and other input requirements, for  
saving  energy  and  labor  demand,  lowering  the  risk  of  methane  emission,  and  
increasing the system productivity. DSR refers to the process of establishing the  
crop from seeds sown in the field rather than by transplanting seedlings from the  
nursery. There are three principal methods of DSR systems: dry seeding (sowing dry  
seeds into dry soil), wet seeding (sowing dry or pre-germinated seeds on puddled  
soil), and water seeding (seeds sown into standing water). DSR, especially dry DSR,  
is becoming popular nowadays because of less water consumption, reduced labor  
intensity, easy mechanization during crop establishment, and less methane emis- 
sion. In the world, 23 % of rice is grown under DSR system. In China, the planting  
area for DSR is increasing rapidly since the 1990s, and DSR is mainly located in the  
middle and lower reaches of Yangtze River in Jiangsu, Anhui, Zhejiang, Guangdong,  
Yunnan, Hubei, and Xinjiang provinces. The proportion of DSR area to total rice  
planting area in China has increased to around 10 %. Wet seeding accounts for over  
80 % of DSR planting area, and manual broadcasting is common in this method (Su  
et al. 2014). Taking Zhejiang Province as an example, the DSR developed fast from  
the 1990s (Wang 2015). During 1995–1999, the proportion of DSR planting area to  
total  rice  planting  area  in  Zhejiang  Province  was  around  10  %,  which  increased

2.7       Major Production Constraints 

2.7.1      Instability in Rice Planting Area and Decline in Labor   
           Availability 

In China, the annual cultivated area of rice has reached 30 million ha, which is  
one- third of the total area of grain crops. During the past three decades, the rice  
cultivation area has reached the highest record of 33.5 million ha in 1990, and  
since then, it declined gradually. In 2003, the area under rice in China was dropped  
to 26.8 million ha. China has introduced many encouragement policies, resulting  
in  restorative  growth  in  rice  planting  since  2004.  In  2013,  rice  planting  area  
climbed  to  30.6  million  ha  (Fig.  2.2).  The  reduction  in  rice  planting  area  was  
largely caused by the construction of new buildings and roads and reforestation on  
marginal arable land. Rice is often in a disadvantageous position when it competes  
with cash crops for planting area. Therefore, most of the future increase in rice  
production must come from greater yields on existing crop land to avoid environ- 
mental  degradation,  destruction  of  natural  ecosystem,  and  loss  of  biodiversity  
(Cassman 1999). 
    Accompanied  by  the  instability  in  rice  planting  area,  the  expansion  of  urban  
areas has led to a labor shortage for agricultural production in rural areas (Cai and  
Chen 2000). In recent years, massive labor force in the age group of 18–40 years has  
migrated to the cities, and both the quantity and quality of labor for rice production  
have markedly declined (Fang et al. 2004). Consequently, the daily wage of labor  
for rice farming has doubled in less than 10 years (Peng et al. 2009).

2.7.2         Narrow Genetic Background  

Narrow genetic background of parent materials is the main cause for the low crop  
yield, quality, and weak stress resistance (both biotic and abiotic), while wild rice  
provides rich genetic resources with good traits such as strong pest resistance and  
stress  tolerance.  More  than  95  %  of  wild  rice  germplasm  collections  worldwide  
have never been used in any breeding program primarily because of the technical  
limitations  of  the  conventional  breeding  approach  (Li  2005).  The  direct  conse- 
quence  of  this  under  use  of  germplasm  resources  by  conventional  breeding  
approaches has been documented to low genetic diversity in commercially grown  
rice cultivars and their vulnerability to biotic and abiotic stresses. The situation is  
even worst in China because 50 % of the rice planting area is occupied by hybrid  
rice (Yuan 2003). Hybrid rice varieties were developed using a few male sterile lines  
as the female parent (Fang et al. 2004). Most of the restorer lines used as a male  
parent were related to tropical indica rice varieties. 

2.7.3          Overuse of Fertilizers 

The excessive use of nitrogenous (N) fertilizer has resulted in decreased nitrogen-  
use  efficiency  and  critical  negative  effects  on  the  environment  (Cassman  1999).  
China is currently the world’s largest consumer of N fertilizers. In 2006, annual N  
fertilizer consumption in China was 31 million metric tons being 31.7 % (almost 1/3  
of worldwide use) of the global N consumption (Heffer and Prud’homme  2008).  
The average rate of N application for rice production in China was 180 kg per hect- 
are, about 75 % higher than the world average (Peng et al. 2002). Because of the  
high rate of N application, only 20–30 % of N is taken up by the rice plant in current  
season, and a large proportion of N is lost to the environment (Peng et al. 2006).  
Therefore, rice grain yield has increased by only 5–10 kg for every kilogram of N  
fertilizer input in China (Peng et al. 2006). Overapplication of N fertilizer may actu- 
ally decrease grain yield by increasing susceptibility to lodging and damage from  
pests and diseases. The excessive use of N fertilizer is also partially responsible for  
the overuse of pesticides (Peng et al.  2002). On an average, Chinese rice farmers  
used 40 % higher pesticides than the actual requirement (Huang et al. 2003). 

2.7.4         Poor Extension System and Oversimplified Crop   
              Management 

China has about 150,000 agro-tech extension and service stations with 1.03 million  
staff members (Fang et al. 2004; Peng et al. 2009). Because of insufficient financial  
support from the government, many extension staff members have to earn part of

2   Rice Production in China                                                                              41 

their salary from selling agrochemicals and seeds to farmers. Therefore, a new tech- 
nology may not be available to the farmers quickly because of a weak extension  
system. This phenomenon is associated with the overuse of fertilizers and pesticides  
by Chinese rice farmers and consequently caused rice yield loss (Fang et al. 2004). 
    The labor input for rice production has significantly decreased in China, espe- 
cially in economically developed regions because of labor migration and increase in  
labor  wages. As  a  consequence,  many  rice  farmers  have  greatly  simplified  crop  
management practices (Cai and Chen 2000; Peng et al. 2009). For example, some  
rice farmers apply fertilizers only once before crop establishment during the whole  
growing season to avoid in-season fertilizer application. Some farmers transplant  
rice at extremely wide spacing to reduce labor cost. As a result, rice grain yield will  
decline under these oversimplified crop management practices. 

2.8       Challenges and Opportunities 

2.8.1       Increasing Yield Potential  

Rice varieties with higher yield potential must be developed to enhance average  
farm yield in order to increase total rice production (Peng et al.  1999). In the past,  
great improvement in rice yield potential was achieved with ample supply of water  
and nutrients (Peng and Bouman 2007). China has been at the forefront in develop- 
ing high-yielding varieties using semidwarf, hybrid, and new plant-type breeding  
approaches. China’s “super” rice breeding project has developed many F1 hybrid  
varieties using the combination of ideotype approach and inter-subspecific heterosis  
(Yu and Lei 2001; Min et al. 2002). In on-farm demonstrations, these hybrid variet- 
ies produced grain yield of 12 tons per hectare, which was 8–15 % higher than that  
of the hybrid check varieties. Yield records have been frequently broken by newly  
developed super hybrid rice varieties. However, it is not easy to achieve high yields  
with the “super” rice varieties consistently across seasons and locations. Because of  
water scarcity and environmental stresses, increase in rice yield with less water and  
chemical input is a great challenge (Peng and Bouman 2007). Zhang (2007) pro- 
posed  strategies  for  developing  GSR.  To  increase  yield  potential,  new  breeding  
techniques such as marker-assisted selection, transformation, and genetic engineer- 
ing should be combined effectively with the conventional breeding methods. 

2.8.2        Varieties with Abiotic and Biotic Resistance 

Rice production in China faces abiotic stresses such as drought, heat, cold, submer- 
gence, etc. Due to global warming, drought and heat episodes are more frequent than  
ever before, causing yield losses in the major rice-growing areas (Tao et al. 2003).

42                                                                          L. Nie and S. Peng 

Scientists have dissected the genetic basis and mapped the genes (QTLs) in crosses  
between drought-tolerant germplasm and elite cultivars (Yue et al. 2006). A molecu- 
lar breeding approach has been used to develop new varieties with drought tolerance,  
and many candidate genes have been identified for engineering drought tolerance in  
rice  (Zhang  2007).  Studies  demonstrated  significant  genotypic  variation  in  high  
temperature-induced   spikelet   sterility,   and   tolerant   varieties   were   identified   
(Prasad et al. 2006). 
   In China, rice crop also suffers from insect infestation (e.g., brown plant hop- 
per, stem borer, etc.) and diseases (blast, bacterial blight, sheath blight, leaf blight,  
false smut), which are causing huge yield losses every year (Wang et al.  2005).  
Infestations of brown plant hopper have become severe in recent years, probably  
because of the breakdown in ecosystem stability caused by the heavy use of pes- 
ticides and the increase in air temperature associated with global warming. It was  
estimated that China lost 2.77 million tons of rice because of brown plant hopper  
outbreaks  in  2005.  Scientists  in  China  have  already  isolated  and  cloned  many  
genes  with  disease  and  insect  resistance  from  cultivated  and  wild  rice  species  
(Zhang 2007). These genes with multiple resistances have been transferred into  
the local varieties through transformation or backcrossing. Bt-transgenic rice is a  
successful example for controlling stem borer although it has not been released  
officially for commercial production (Huang et al. 2005). For disease resistance,  
another strategy is to focus on quantitative resistance (mostly polygenic) that pro- 
vides  broad-spectrum  resistance  against  multiple  pathogen  races  or  different  
pathogens (Mew et al. 2004). This can be combined with major resistance genes  
to achieve a higher crop resistance. 
   Because weeds germinate concurrently with rice and there is no water layer to  
suppress weed growth, DSR fields are more species rich with greater diversity in  
weed flora than flood-transplanted rice (Tomita et al. 2003; Rao et al. 2007; Jabran  
et al.  2015). High weed infestation can incur 74 % yield losses under dry DSR  
system,  and  sometimes  it  may  result  in  total  crop  failure  (Jabran  et  al.  2012;  
Jabran  and  Chauhan  2015).  In  China,  weeding  in  dry  DSR  is  usually  done  by  
labor; however, farmers have been shifting to herbicides application because of  
less labor availability and high labor cost. In recent years, a series of herbicides  
have been successfully used, including single herbicides and the combination of  
different herbicides to control weeds. Although herbicides have played an impor- 
tant role in controlling rice weeds, nonetheless, intensive use of herbicides brought  
negative effects on the rice seed emergence, risk of herbicide resistance in weeds,  
and environmental pollution (Heap 2012). Various nonchemical methods of weed  
control have been explored, such as development of weed-competitive cultivars,  
increasing seeding rate, and use of crop residue as mulches. Development of vari- 
eties with early seedling vigor and rapid leaf area development during the early  
vegetative stage has been proven to be the most cost-effective strategy for weed  
suppression (Mahajan and Chauhan 2013). However, further studies on genotypic  
variation in weed tolerance traits, including early seedling vigor and allelopathy,  
are needed.

2.8.3       Integrated Crop Management  

It is generally believed that the contribution of optimal crop management to yield  
increase is greater than that of new varieties (Fang et al.  2004). Optimum crop  
management  practices  have  been  developed  in  China  in  the  past.  Scientists  in  
Jiangsu province have highlighted the plant and canopy morphological parameters  
to guide the crop management at different growth stages for achieving maximum  
grain yield (Ling et al.  1993; Su et al. 2002). In order to raise rice seedlings for  
transplanting, dry bed has been adopted nationally since 1990s instead of wet bed  
by modifying the technology originated from Japan (Chen 2003). Another popular  
practice since the 1990s was seedling throwing. In 1999, the total rice planting area  
using   seedling   throwing   reached   6   million   hectares   in   China   (Zhu   2000).  
Rectangular planting with wide spacing between rows and narrow spacing between  
hills within a row has become a common planting geometry for panicle-weight- 
type  rice  varieties  such  as  “super”  hybrid  rice  (Zou  2006).  Zhong  et  al.  (2007)  
technically specified “Three Controls” nutrient management technology for irri- 
gated rice, which includes four parts, i.e., the determination of total fertilizer-N  
input, fertilizer-N timing and split rates at key growth stages, amount and timing of  
phosphorus and potassium requirement, and adoption of the other crop manage- 
ment  measures.  Some  of  these  technologies  have  significantly  contributed  in  
increased rice yield, although their impact on the environment and on resource-use  
efficiency was largely ignored. 
    Socioeconomic assessment was not commonly conducted for each new technol- 
ogy, and there was a lack of integration among the different components of crop  
management practices. In the future, new crop management technologies will have  
to be developed using system approaches as rice farming faces many challenges in  
China. The newly developed practices should have a sound scientific basis. Synergy  
among fertilizer, water, and pest management should be considered to maximize  
overall efficiency of the production system. Furthermore, a new technology should  
not be based merely on yield and farmers’ profit, but its short- and long-term impacts  
on the environment, i.e., sustainability, should also be considered. Sustainability of  
the rice production systems can be maintained only when the natural resource base  
is protected and ecosystem services of the rice system are maximized. These points  
have been addressed on site-specific nutrient management (SSNM) in six provinces  
of China and its dissemination through farmer participatory research (Peng et al.  
2006; Hu et al. 2007). 

2.9       Nitrogen Fertilizer and Pest Management 

The  average  rate  of  N  application  for  rice  production  in  China  is180  kg  ha−1  
(Peng et al. 2010), and N rates of 150 to 250 kg ha−1 are common (Wang et al.  

2001;  Peng  et  al.  2006).  In  Jiangsu  Province,  the  average  N  rate  reached  to  

----------------------- Page 51-----------------------

44                                                                       L. Nie and S. Peng 

300 kg ha−1 (Peng et al.  2010). It has been reported that indigenous N supply  

capacity of irrigated rice fields in China was about 50 % higher than other major  
rice-growing countries; therefore, yield response of rice crop to N fertilizer appli- 
cation is low. Overapplication of N fertilizer may actually decrease grain yield by  
increasing susceptibility to lodging (Pham et al.  2004) and damage from pests  
and diseases (Cu et al.  1996). Peng et al. (2006) reported that the average agro- 
nomic N use efficiency was 5–10 kg grains kg−1 N in the farmers’ production  

fields of China. The abnormal high rates of N fertilizer input and improper timing  
of N application in China have led to low N use efficiency. 
   Site-specific N management (SSNM) was developed to increase N use efficiency  
of  irrigated  rice  (Dobermann  and  Cassman  2002).  It  was  reported  that  SSNM  
recorded higher grain yield and N use efficiency compared with farmers’ N fertil- 
izer practice in China (Peng et al. 2002). After a decade of collaborative research  
work on SSNM between IRRI and Chinese scientists, researchers and farmers have  
a deep understanding of N fertilizer management for irrigated rice in China. SSNM  
is becoming a matured technology for improving both fertilizer-N use efficiency  
and grain yield. However, the procedure of SSNM is too complicated, and it is dif- 
ficult to accurately estimate N response and select the right agronomic N use effi- 
ciency  based  on  SSNM  procedure. To  disseminate  SSNM  technology  widely  in  
China,  we  should  further  simplify  the  procedure  of  SSNM.  Therefore,  future  
research is needed to develop SSNM based on remote sensing technology for its  
large-scale implications. 
   In China, insect pests, diseases, and weeds are the major challenges to rice pro- 
duction (Oerke and Dehne 2004). Globally, an average of 35 % of potential crop  
yield is lost due to preharvest pests (Oerke  2006), while actual losses were esti- 
mated at 40 % for rice grains (Oerke and Dehne 2004). Pesticides, as an important  
input in agricultural production, have made a great contribution to the development  
of agriculture and food supply to mankind (Wang and Li 2007). Existing data have  
indicated that one-third of pest-induced yield losses worldwide were avoided and  
recovered because of application of agrochemicals (Liu et al.  2002). At present,  
China is ranked first in the world regarding production ability and application of  
pesticides. However, Chinese farmers usually overestimate the crop losses caused  
by pests resulting in an indiscriminate and overuse of pesticides in rice production  
(Fang et al. 2004). To avoid yield losses, farmers sometimes spray their rice crop  
weekly to control pests and diseases. Econometric analysis showed that education  
and quality of the extension system are the major determinants for the improper  
perceptions of farmer’s regarding yield losses. 
   Overuse of pesticides has raised several environmental issues and led to several  
health  hazards;  therefore,  several  nonchemical  approaches  for  controlling  rice  
 diseases, insect pests, and weeds have been studied and implicated, specifically,  
e.g., (1) using rice resistance genomic diversity;(2) changing rice seeding time/ 
transplanting date;(3) rearing fish, frogs, or ducks in rice paddy fields; (4) soaking

rice seeds in biogas fermentative liquid and cultivating seedlings with biogas fer- 
mentative  residues;  and  (6)  using  Frequoscillation  Pest-killing  Lamps  (Huang  
et al. 2014). 

2.10      Harvesting and Yields 

In this modern era, rice harvesting through mechanical means is common in China.  
Mechanical harvest is divided into “mechanical cutting and mechanical picking”  
and “harvesting by combine harvester.” At present, combine harvester is used in  
more than 80 % of the rice planting area of China (Huang and Guo 2014). Harvesting  
of rice by using combine harvester gives the highest efficiency and the lowest cost;  
however, seed moisture content should be considered. Especially in some places  
without drying facilities, rice can be harvested when seed moisture content drops  
below the safe water content. It was estimated that more than 80 % of the rice area  
cannot be harvested at proper time due to poor dehydration, which usually causes  
5–10 % of yield loss (Huang and Guo 2014). 
   Rice processing is a combination of several operations to convert paddy rice into  
well-milled  silky-white  rice,  which  has  superior  cooking  quality  attributes.  The  
marketing values of rice as an agricultural product depend on its physical characters  
after the processing. The percentage of whole grain is the most important parameter  
for the rice processing industry (Marchezan  1991). In China, the brown rice per- 
centage and head rice percentage are relatively lower compared with that in Japan.  
A multiyear survey (2008–2012) reported that brown rice percentage and head rice  
percentage in China are 63.4–66.3 % and around 55 %, respectively, and are declin- 
ing year by year (Tan et al. 2014). The decline in brown rice percentage and head  
rice percentage was mainly caused by overprocessing, because at present, rice pro- 
cessing industry in China is still in the stage of pursuing the appearance quality (Tan  
et al. 2014). Overprocessing has resulted in the loss of nutrients and the increase in  
the amount of by-products. Accuracy in processing may increase the brown rice  
percentage and head rice percentage (Tan et al. 2014). 
   Rice aging during storage is a complicated process, which involves changes  
in the physical and chemical properties of rice grain. Starch, protein, and lipids  
are  the  main  rice  grain  components  which  affect  cooking  and  eating  quality.  
Safe storage plays an important role in reducing food losses and ensuring rice  
quality. According to Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations,  
15–16 % of the rice was lost due to improper storage and postharvest processing  
(FAOSTAT 2006). The edible quality of rice will obviously change with storage  
time  and  storage  conditions,  mainly  expressed  as  decrease  in  viscosity,  taste,  
and aroma. At present, China has a wide range of uniform regulations on the safe  
water content (13.5 % for indica rice and 14.5 % for japonica rice). However,  

----------------------- Page 53-----------------------

46                                                                           L. Nie and S. Peng 

with increasing mechanized farming, traditional rice drying after the harvest is  
gradually simplified due to lack of space and other reasons, and the rice grains  
with  high  moisture  content  are  directly  transferred  to  the  market.  Previously,  
Huang (2014) reported that mold growth on rice surface was reduced at 20°C  
storage. It was also observed that rice respiration, enzyme activity, and propaga- 
tion  of  insects  and  mold  during  storage  were  inhibited  below  10  °C  (Huang  
2014).  The  safe  moisture  content  of  rice  in  China  for  a  long- term  storage  at  
room temperature is limited to 13.5 %; however, for low temperature storage,  
the safe moisture content of rice can be kept below 15.5 % for japonica rice and  
14.5 % for indica rice (Han et al. 2014). 

2.11       Heavy Metal Pollution 

In China, nearly 10 billion (100 million) ha of arable land has been contaminated by  
heavy  metals  mainly,  cadmium,  arsenic,  lead,  copper,  nickel,  zinc,  mercury,  and  
chromium (Jin 2014). In Zhujiang delta region of southern China, 28 % of soil has  
been reported to be contaminated with heavy metals (Xue et al. 2013). Soil contami- 
nation  by  the  heavy  metals  is  governed  by  several  factors  including  solid-waste  
disposal and atmospheric deposition. Moreover, fertilizer and pesticide use, appli- 
cation of the wastewater irrigation, and sewage sludge in the field are also consid- 
ered to be the major cause of heavy metal accumulation (Cui et al. 2005; Wilson and  
Pyatt 2007; Khan et al. 2008). 
    Rice has been considered to be a major source of heavy metal intake by humans  
in Asian countries (Tsukahara et al. 2003; Mondal and Polya 2008; Solidum et al.  
2012).  It  is  crucial  to  develop  practical  and  effective  strategies  for  reducing  the  
amount and mobility of heavy metals in soil or to limit their uptake and accumula- 
tion in rice grains. Zhao et al. (2010) and Kawasaki et al. (2012) reported a great  
impact of water management practices on dynamics of heavy metals in soil and  
their subsequent uptake by rice. Sun et al. (2014) and Liu et al. (2014) suggested  
that a significant reduction in heavy metals’ accumulation in rice grains could be  
achieved  by  aerobic-flooded  cultivation  of  rice.  It  was  reported  that  aerobic  and  
alternate wet and dry cultivation of rice reduced the As and Mo concentration in  
milled rice, compared to the traditional flooded rice, and decreased the Zn, Mn, Ni,  
Cu, Cd, and Co concentration in milled rice, compared with upland/aerobic rice  
(Fig. 2.3). 
    Bioavailability of heavy metals is closely related to soil pH and soil redox poten- 
tial (Eh) (Fu et al. 2008; Talukder et al. 2012). Many studies have shown that the  
availability of metal elements was closely related to the decreasing pH (Itanna 1998;  
Sukreeyapongse et al. 2002). Along with pH, Eh is also influenced by soil water  
conditions, thus affecting the elements of availability in soil (Fu et al. 2008; Talukder  
et al. 2012). There are still many other factors influenced by soil water conditions  
that affect the heavy metal concentration in rice grain, such as the organic matter  
content,  EC  of  soil,  root  activity,  and  rhizosphere  environment  (Liu  et  al.  2001;  
Zarcinas et al. 2004).

2.12       Conclusions 

Due to the increasing population and limited land resources, increases in rice pro- 
duction of China mainly depend on yield improvement rather than expansion of  
planting area. In such circumstances, scientific and technological innovation will  
continue to play an important role in increasing rice yields. Developing new tech- 
nologies of crop management using system approaches is inevitable as rice farming  
faces many challenges in China. New technology should mainly be judged based on  
its short- and long-term impacts on the environment along with yield and farmers’  
profit. Synergy among fertilizer, water, and pest and weed management should be  
considered to maximize overall efficiency of the rice production system. 
    Great achievements in super hybrid rice breeding have been made in recent years  
in  China,  and  the  yield  of  some  hybrids  is  approaching  their  genetic  potential.  
Therefore, further increase in yield seems to be rather difficult. Exploitation of indica/ 
japonica heterosis can improve the level of yield. With the development of molecular  
marker technology in rice, the subspecies differentiation of parents can be determined,  
and the proper contribution of indica and japonica characters in the hybrids can be  
established for higher yields in combination with harmonious plant types. Furthermore,  
incorporating the characteristics of high photosynthetic rate in other species (C ) into 4 
rice plants could be worthwhile for future super hybrid rice breeding.

Rice Production in India

3.1      Introduction 

Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is a principal food crop of south and southeastern countries.  
It is the staple food for more than two-thirds of the Indian population, thus holds the  
key for food security and plays a pivotal role in national economy. The demand for  
rice is expected to grow continuously as population is continuously growing. 
    The rice plant belongs to the genus  Oryza of Poaceae (old Gramineae) family.  
The genus Oryza includes 24 species, of which only two species, viz., Oryza sativa  
and Oryza glaberrima, are cultivable and the rest 22 species are wild. Rice varieties  
which belong to sativa are further grouped into three subspecies, viz., indica, japon - 
ica, and javanica . India is the producer of rice varieties which belongs to the sub- 
species indica (DRD 2014). Rice is an annual plant which usually grows to a height  
of 0.5–2 m; however, there are some varieties which can grow up to 6 or 9 m high.  
Some rice varieties are also in existence which can grow when the flood water level  
gradually rises.

   No doubt, India has its own position in rice area and production in the world, but  
still  there  are  some  problems  and  constraints  in  rice  production  in  the  country.  
Highlighting issues regarding constraints for increasing and maintaining the pro- 
ductivity of rice-based systems are (1) the inefficient use of resources (water, labor,  
and fertilizers) and their growing scarcity, (2) effect of climate change, (3) rising  
fuel  prices  and  emerging  energy  crisis,  (4)  reducing  farm  profitability,  and  (5)  
emerging socioeconomic changes such as migration of labor to urban areas, liking  
for nonagricultural work, and concerns about environmental pollution (Ladha et al.  
2009). Besides this, fragmentation of land and abiotic and biotic stress are also main  
issues  which  are  threatening  rice  productivity  and  sustainability. To  tackle  these  
problems, new agronomic management and technological innovations are needed. 
   Currently, water productivity for rice in India is 2500–3500 l/kg. In order to deal  
with the problem of degrading water resource base, there is a need to improve the  
water productivity of rice by bringing from the current level of 2500–3500 l/kg to  
the level of 2000 l/kg (Mohapatra et al. 2013). It can be done by conservation till- 
age, drip irrigation, soil amendment, and mulching. Nutrient use efficiency needs to  
be enhanced for increasing and sustaining the rice productivity in India. There is a  
need to increase nitrogen, phosphorus, and zinc use efficiencies by 20–40, 40–50,  
and 50–100 %, respectively, for various rice production systems (Mohapatra et al.  
2013). This is possible through agronomic manipulations, e.g., time and method of  
application, vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizae, biofertilizers, and precision manage- 
ment of nutrients. Besides this, there is a need to work aggressively in collaboration  
with plant breeders to develop effective screening tools to identify novel germplasm  
with greater input (water, nutrient) use efficiency, e.g., root studies for high input  
use efficiency, screening genotypes on the basis of nutrient uptake efficiency indi- 
ces, stress and biochemical indices, etc. 
   Reducing  labor  dependence  by  one-third  from  the  current  level  may  increase  
profitability in rice production (Mohapatra et al.  2013). This is possible through  
mechanization in different practices of rice cultivation, viz., land preparation, sow- 
ing methods, nutrition management, harvesting, etc. Combination of various stresses  
(abiotic, biotic, and nutritional) also limits rice yields (Mohapatra et al. 2013). The  
major abiotic stress which prevents rice crops from realizing their full yield poten- 
tial is due to drought, heat, cold, salinity, and submergence. Similarly, biotic stresses,  
viz., pests and diseases, destroy a large portion of produce during cultivation and  
storage. For a sustainable yield over the years, these biotic and abiotic stresses need  
to  be  removed.  Stress  tolerance  is  complex  phenomena  and  require  various  
approaches for providing solution to plants experiencing the multiple environmen- 
tal stresses (Mohapatra et al. 2013). Field screening of novel germplasm is required  
to find putative stress-related genes for developing resilient set of new germplasm  
which can better adapt to withstand with a stressful environment. 
   The most common method for rice establishment is transplanting of young seed- 
lings into puddled soil (wet tillage) in India. But this production method is becom- 
ing less profitable these days because it is a water-, labor-, and energy-intensive  
method and these resources are becoming increasingly scarce (Kumar and Ladha  
2011). Besides this, transplanted rice causes the deterioration of physical properties  
of soil and also emits methane gas (an important greenhouse gas) in the atmosphere.  
All these factors act as a driver of the shift from puddled transplanting to direct

seeding of rice (DSR). DSR is the technology which is water, labor, and energy  
efficient along with eco-friendly characteristics and can be used as a potential alter- 
native  to  conventional  puddled  transplanted  rice  (Kumar  and  Ladha  2011).  No  
doubt, direct seeding method has several benefits as compared to puddled trans- 
planting,  which  include  similar  yield  level,  economized  irrigation  water,  labor,  
reduced cost of production and thus increased net returns, and methane emission  
reduction. However, there are also some risks associated with adoption of direct  
seeding method. These include the introduction of hard-to-control and herbicide-  
resistant weed flora; evolution of weedy rice; higher emissions of nitrous oxide, a  
potent greenhouse gas; nutrient disorders, especially N and micronutrients such as  
Fe and Zn; and increases in soilborne pathogens such as nematodes (Kumar and  
Ladha 2011). 
    Rice  can  be  grown  under  diverse  climatic  conditions.  It  is  best  suited  in  the  
regions  having  high  humidity  and  temperature,  prolonged  sunshine  hours,  and  
assured water supply. Rice can grow well on soils over wide range of pH 5 to 9 and  
with low permeability soils that provide better environment for its growth. Generally,  
the loamy soils are best suited for rice cultivation. Because of the adaptability of rice  
to different soil conditions, it is said that it can be grown on any type of soils includ- 
ing alkaline and acidic soils. This wide physical adaptability of rice plant allows the  
rice plants to be grown below sea level which includes the Kuttanad area of Kerala  
up  to  a  height  of  2000  m  in  Jammu  and  Kashmir,  Himachal  Pradesh,  hills  of  
Uttaranchal, and northeastern hill (NEH) region.

     In  India,  the  rice-growing  areas  have  been  broadly  grouped  into  five  regions  
(Meera et al. 2014a): 

3.1.1        Northeastern Region  

The  northeastern  region  includes Assam  and  northeastern  states. The  main  rice-  
growing area in Assam is the basin of Brahmaputra River. In this area, rice is culti- 
vated under rainfed conditions, because the area receives very heavy rainfall. 

3.1.2        Eastern Region  

This region includes Eastern Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Madhya  
Pradesh, Odisha, and West Bengal. In India, the basins of Ganges and Mahanadi  
rivers are the major rice-growing region with the highest intensity of rice cultiva- 
tion. This region also receives heavy rainfall, so rice is generally grown under rain- 
fed conditions. 

3.1.3        Northern Region  

Punjab,  Haryana,  Uttrakhand,  Western  Uttar  Pradesh,  Himachal  Pradesh,  and  
Jammu and Kashmir are included in northern region. In winter season, low tempera- 
ture is experienced in this region, and a single crop of rice can be grown from May– 
July to September–October. 

3.1.4         Western Region 

This region includes Gujarat, Maharashtra, and Rajasthan. Rice is largely grown  
under rainfed conditions during June–August to October–December. 

3.1.5         Southern Region 

Andhra  Pradesh,  Karnataka,  Kerala,  and  Tamil  Nadu  cover  the  southern  region.  
Major rice-growing areas in this region are the deltaic tracts of Krishna, Godavari,  
and Cauvery rivers and the non-deltaic rainfed areas of Andhra Pradesh and Tamil  
Nadu. In the deltaic tracts, rice cultivation is done under irrigated conditions.

3.2        Important Growing Ecology of Rice 

In  terms  of  photoperiodism,  rice  is  a  short-day  plant.  However,  several  varieties  
have been introduced which are nonsensitive to photoperiodic conditions. With the  
introduction  of  photoperiod  and  thermo-insensitive  and  relatively  short-duration  
varieties of rice, remarkable changes have been observed in the cropping system  
concepts (Sharma et al. 2004). On the basis of soil variations and agroclimatic con- 
ditions in the major rice-growing states of the country, different rice-based cropping  
systems have been adopted in the different ecologies. India is the only country in the  
world which has much diversity in rice ecosystems. Because of this diversity in rice  
ecosystem, four different types of ecosystems have been developed in India (Meera  
et al. 2014a). These are: 

 1.  Irrigated rice ecosystem 
 2.  Rainfed upland rice ecosystem 
 3.  Rainfed lowland rice ecosystem 
 4.  Flood-prone rice ecosystem 

3.2.1        Irrigated Rice Ecosystem  

Under the irrigated ecosystem, wet season (June to October) is the main season for rice  
cultivation; however, in a small area, rice is also grown in dry season (November to May)  
(Rao et al. 2008). In India, about 22 million hectares area is under irrigated rice ecosys- 
tems, which is about 49.5 % of the total rice area in the country. Major states where rice  
is  grown  under  irrigated  conditions  are  Punjab,  Haryana,  Uttar  Pradesh,  Himachal  
Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Sikkim, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, and  
Gujarat. Bunding of paddy fields is the prerequisite for irrigated rice cultivation. 

3.2.2        Rainfed Upland Rice Ecosystem  

Globally, upland ecosystem for rice cultivation is present in Asia, Africa, and Latin  
America.  In  India, Assam,  Bihar,  West  Bengal,  Odisha,  eastern  parts  of  Madhya  
Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh, and northeastern hill region cover 85 % of the upland rice  
area (Rao et al. 2008). In the country, about six million hectares of area is under upland  
rainfed rice, which accounts 13.5 % of the total area under rice crop in the country.  
Monsoon season is the main season for rice cultivation in this ecosystem. The tem- 
perature range in this zone is from 25 to 40 °C in July and from 6 to 25 °C in January,  
and it receives rainfall in the range of 1000–2000 mm or more. In this ecosystem,  
mostly  direct  sown  rice  is  grown,  and  the  rice  fields  are  generally  dry,  unbunded.  
About 55 % of the total rice area in this zone contain red laterite and lateritic soils such  
as mixed red and yellow, red sandy, red loam, lateritic, and mixed red and brown hill  
soils. Besides this, alluvial soil also occupies nearly 27 % of the total rice area.

3.2.3        Rainfed Lowland Rice Ecosystem  

In India, rainfed lowland rice is grown in around 14.4 million hectares, mostly in  
Eastern India, where availability of soil moisture remains for longer period. This  
area accounts 32.4 % of the total rice area of the country. In these areas, mostly  
photosensitive varieties having 140 days duration are grown. There is much varia- 
tions in water depth in this ecosystem, which can be shallow (up to 25 cm), medium  
deep (up to 50 cm), or deep (up to 2 m). Depending on the water depth in the field,  
medium- to long-duration cultivars are grown. For better performance, these culti- 
vars should have tolerance to drought at initial stage and submergence at later stage,  
moderate to high tillering ability, photosensitivity, tolerance to pest and diseases,  
and elongation ability in semi-deep or deepwater situations. 
     There is lack of technology in rice production in this ecosystem so there is much  
variations  in  production.  The  major  problems  in  rainfed  lowland  ecosystem  are  
erratic yields due to drought/flood conditions and poor soil quality. 

3.2.4        Flood-Prone Rice Ecosystem  

Flood-prone rice is adapted in those areas where farmers have to face temporary  
submergence of 1–10 days or long period submergence of 1–5 months in depths  
from 50 to 400 cm or more. This is also adapted where daily tidal fluctuations may  
also cause complete submergence (Mohanty et al. 2013). Globally, flood-prone eco- 
systems are found in South and Southeast Asia as extreme floods, and drought often  
occurred in these areas. In India, 26 % of the total cultivated area and 4.6 % of the  
total rice-grown area are under flood-prone rice ecosystems. Yield in these ecosys- 
tems are very low (1.5 t ha−1) and variable. June to November is the main season for  

flood  occurrence  during  the  wet  season.  Rice  varieties  are  selected  according  to  
their level of tolerance to submergence. 

3.3        History, Importance, Area, and Production 

3.3.1        History  

Rice is believed to be originated in Asia. Among the different rice species, the domi- 
nant rice species  Oryza sativa has originated in Southeast Asia. Rice is thought to  
be developed from wild grass that was grown in the foothills of the Far Eastern  
Himalayas. It is also believed that the origin of rice plant may be in Southern India,  
and  after  its  origination,  it  was  adopted  in  the  North  India  and  then  in  China.  
Thereafter, it spread to Korea, then about 2000 B.C. in Philippines, and then about  
1000 B.C. in Japan and Indonesia (DRD 2014). Some scientists (De Condole 1986;  
Watt  1892) believe that cultivated rice was originated in Southern India. However,  

----------------------- Page 66-----------------------

3   Rice Production in India                                                                               59 

some others (Vavilov 1926) thought that India and Burma (Myanmar) was the place  
where cultivated rice was originated. After origin, it spread around the world very  
slowly,  but  once  it  reached  in  any  area,  it  became  an  important  product  for  the  
people from agriculture and economic point of view. 
    It is believed by the historians that the area covering the foothills of the Eastern  
Himalayas  (i.e.,  northeastern  India),  stretching  through  Burma,  Thailand,  Laos,  
Vietnam, and Southern China, domesticated indica variety of rice. At the same time,  
the japonica  variety from wild rice was domesticated by Southern China, which was  
introduced to India thereafter. It seems that after its adoption in the northern plains,  
it proceeded to Southern India around 1400 B.C. Then it spread to all those areas  
which were under the influence of rivers, e.g., fertile alluvial plains watered by riv- 
ers. In Assam and Nepal, some perennial wild rice varieties are still being grown  
(DRD 2014). The word rice is considered to be derived from the Tamil word arisi.  
Rice was first mentioned in the  Yajur Veda (1500–800 B.C.) and then frequently  
referred in Sanskrit texts. 
    Chatterjee (1948) suggested that genus Oryza has altogether 24 species, of which  
2, viz., Oryza sativa and Oryza glaberrima, are cultivated and 22 are wild. In most  
of the rice-growing areas, O. sativa is prevalent; however,  O. glaberrima is grown  
in West Africa only. So he believed that the cultivated rice might have two centers  
of  origin:  West  Africa  and  Southeastern  Asia  including  Myanmar,  India,  and  
Thailand. 

3.3.2       Importance  

India is one of the important centers of rice farming and occupied the largest area  
under rice cultivation (DRD 2014). In the Indian subcontinent in 2011–2012, more  
than a quarter of the cultivated land was occupied by rice. In the southern and east- 
ern parts of India, it is considered as a very important and essential part of the daily  
meal. Rice plays a vital role in shaping the diets, culture, and economics of thou- 
sands of millions of peoples in the world. It will not be wrong to say that “rice is  
life” for more than 50 % of the humanity. Rice is an important staple food crop for  
more than 50 % of the world population. Besides this, rice straw, husk, and bran are  
also used as cattle feed, in cottage industry for preparation of hats, mats, ropes,  
sound absorbents, straw board, and as litter material and fuel sources. Keeping its  
importance  in  view,  the  year  2004  was  designated  as  the  “International Year  of  
Rice” by the United Nation (DRD 2014). 

3.3.3       Area and Production  

At the global level, rice is the most widely grown crop which occupies an area of  
about 161.8 million hectares, of which Asia covers about 143.2 million hectares.  
Similarly, out of the total world rice production of 701.1 million tons of paddy,  

----------------------- Page 67-----------------------

60                                                                              G. Mahajan et al. 

Asia  contributes  approximately  633.7  million  tons  (FAO  Statistical  Yearbook  
2013). Although the largest area under rice crop in the world (43 m ha) is in India,  
average  productivity  is  much  higher  in  the  USA,  China,  and  Japan,  i.e.,  nearly  
more than twice of that in India. No doubt, much increase in productivity has been  
reported from 1950–1951 to 2011–2012 in India. In 1950–1951, rice productivity  
in India was 6.68 q ha−1, which increased to 23.95 q ha−1 in 2011–2012. An increas- 

ing trend in rice production has been shown from 1950 to1951, and a record level  
of  105.3  million  tons  was  achieved  in  2011–2012  (Mohapatra  et  al.  2013).  
Introduction  of  high-yielding  and  fertilizer-responsive  varieties  combined  with  
improved package of practices introduced by agricultural scientists for different  
regions are the main reasons for increase in productivity of rice which is about  
258 % (Mohapatra et al. 2013). 
    Kharif season is considered as the main season for rice cultivation in the country  
as the major share of rice is cultivated during this time. However, rabi/summer sea- 
son  also  contributes  a  small  share  of  rice  in  the  assured  irrigation  conditions.  
Monsoon plays a very important role in Indian rice production as rice production is  
dependent on monsoon rains to a great extent. Only 59 % of the total rice area is  
covered under assured irrigation (DRD 2014). 
    The  most  important  rice-growing  and  rice-consuming  area  in  India  is  in  the  
eastern region which accounts for about 63.3 % of India’s rice-growing area. It  
comprises  of  West  Bengal,  Bihar,  Odisha,  Eastern  Uttar  Pradesh,  Assam,  and  
Eastern Madhya Pradesh. In this region, only 35 % of the total people reside; how- 
ever, their demand is about 49 % of the rice grown in the country (Thiyagarajan and  
Gujja 2013). 
    Area, production, and yield of rice during 2010–2011 and 2013–2014 in major  
producing states is given in Table 3.1. 

3.4      Rice-Based Cropping Systems 

In  any  particular  area,  there  are  four  main  factors  on  which  a  cropping  system  
depends: water resources, land topography, soil textural properties, and marketing  
facilities in the area. All these factors vary to a greater extent even within an area or  
region. In South Asia, particularly in India, the importance of rice-based multiple  
cropping systems is appreciated because of the changes occurring in socioeconomic  
system, population, and food production dynamics by the turn of the century. Now,  
rice-based cropping systems have dominated over all the other cropping systems in  
the country, as rice is grown all over the country with a number of crops either in  
intercropping or in sequence with rice, most of these are 1 year cropping systems.  
In  the  past,  crops  other  than  rice  were  not  grown  in  the  current  traditional  rice-  
growing areas, because of prevailing climatic conditions, inadequate arrangements  
of drainage, and lack of irrigation facilities. But now, either double cropping of rice  
or inclusion of rabi crops in sequence with rice is being adopted. It has become pos- 
sible  due  to  the  improvement  in  irrigation  facilities  (Srivastava  and  Mahapatra

aFourth Advance Estimates 

2012).  Besides  this,  introduction  of  high-yielding  photo-  and  thermo-insensitive  
rice varieties of relatively shorter duration also brought remarkable changes in the  
cropping system concept (Sharma et al. 2004). 
    The Project Directorate of Cropping System Research (PDCSR) has identified  
approximately 500 cropping systems on the basis of rational spread of crops in dif- 
ferent agroclimatic regions of the country, of which only 30 cropping systems are  
important as there is a sizable area under these cropping systems (Yadav et al. 1998).  
The largest area in the country is covered by various rice-based cropping systems  
such  as  rice-wheat,  rice-rice,  rice-chickpea/lentil,  rice-mustard/linseed,  and  rice-  
peanut. Among different rice-based cropping systems, the major share of food grain  
pool of the nation is contributed by rice-wheat and rice-rice cropping systems. Other  
rice-based cropping systems such as rice-mustard, rice-peanut, rice-chickpea, rice-  
green gram, etc., have their significant contribution to the national production of  
oilseed and pulse crops (Tiwari et al. 2013). 
    In  India,  more  than  44  million  hectare  area  is  occupied  by  rice  under  three  
major ecosystems, rainfed uplands (16 % area), irrigated medium lands (45 %),  
and rainfed lowlands (39 %), with a productivity of 0.87, 2.24 and 1.55 t ha−1,  

respectively  (Tiwari  et  al.  2013). Thus,  rice-based  production  systems  provide  
livelihood  for  more  than  50  million  households.  The  population  has  already  
crossed one billion mark, and by the year 2030, it is expected to reach around 1.5  
billion. To meet the demand of Indian population, currently the food grain demand

is estimated at 240 million tons. Keeping this in view, the National Food Security  
Mission had been launched by the Government of India to achieve the production  
of  additional  10,  8,  and  2  million  tons  of  rice,  wheat,  and  pulses,  respectively  
(NFSM 2012). The mission met with an overwhelming success and achieved the  
targeted  additional  production  of  rice,  wheat,  and  pulses.  The  mission  is  now  
continued with new targets of additional production of food grains of 25 million  
tons of food grains comprising of 10 million tons rice, 8 million tons of wheat, 4  
million tons of pulses, and 3 million tons of coarse cereals by 2017. In order to  
make agriculture an attractive, profitable, and sustainable enterprise, it is neces- 
sary to shift from traditional food grain production systems to newer cropping  
systems under rice-based production systems depending upon the agroclimatic  
conditions (Rao et al. 2008). State-wise area under different rice-based cropping  
systems is given in Table 3.2. 
    For the revolutionary increase in rice production, it is necessary to divert the  
kharif  area  to  the  rice  crop  in  kharif  season  in  the  states  of  Punjab,  Haryana,  
Himachal  Pradesh,  Jammu  and  Kashmir,  western  Uttar  Pradesh,  and  Rajasthan  
where irrigation facilities are available. Actually, in most parts of the country in the  
states  mentioned  above,  such  a  change  in  the  cropping  pattern  has  already  been  
occurred. It is expected that the major irrigated kharif areas will be under the rice  
crop during the course of the next decade (Srivastava and Mahapatra 2012). 

3.4.1        Rice-Based Cropping Systems Under Different Ecologies  

The  multiple  crop  demonstrations  have  been  conducted  under  the  National  
Demonstration Scheme to find the efficient cropping system in different parts of the  
country. These demonstrations have shown that a rice-wheat rotation can give a total  
annual production of over 10 t ha−1 year−1 in the states of Uttar Pradesh, Himachal  

Pradesh, Haryana, and Punjab. In the north and the northwestern parts of the coun- 
try, rice followed by wheat has proved to be a very productive and profitable crop  
sequence. However, rice followed by rice is the most efficient system in terms of  
production in the south and southeastern states of the country. In Eastern India, for  
the slightly dry hot zone, the rice-wheat rotation was the best under the upland to  
medium land conditions and for the slightly moist and hot zone; rice-rice rotation  
was the best under medium to lowland conditions. In Western and Central India, the  
highest production in kharif was obtained from the rice crop. However, wheat which  
follows rice produces less yields as compared to the wheat crop grown after maize  
or sorghum. Thus, a yield level of 10–15 t ha−1 year−1 can be obtained in all the rice- 

growing ecologies with a proper selection of crops, varieties, and agronomic prac- 
tices (Srivastava and Mahapatra 2012). 
    In multilocational experiments conducted under the Cropping System Research  
Projects,  many  rice-based  cropping  systems  suited  to  different  soil  and  climatic  
conditions have been identified in terms of agronomic productivity, physiological  
output, and economic feasibility (Annual Report 2001–2002). Promising rice-based

cropping systems with high productivity and intensive land use for diverse agrocli- 
matic situations of India are given in Table 3.3 (Rao et al. 2008). 
    Different  ecologies  have  their  specific  cropping  systems  in  India.  In  rainfed  
upland ecosystems, short-duration varieties of 90–105 days are cultivated. The sow- 
ing is completed during the onset of monsoon, so as to vacate the fields early for the  
second crop (Saha et al. 2003). Major crops in this ecosystem are mustard, castor,  
linseed,  safflower,  black  gram,  lentil,  horse  gram,  etc.,  which  take  advantage  of  
residual  soil  moisture  and  late  monsoon  rains.  System  productivity  and  farmer  
income can also be improved by intercropping of rice with short-duration pulses  
like green gram, black gram, or oilseeds like peanut (Tiwari et al. 2013). Cropping  
intensity and total productivity of the system is very low in northeastern hill (NEH)  
region  because  successful  rabi  cropping  is  very  difficult.  It  can  be  increased  by  
intercropping soybean, pigeon pea, and peanut with rice. Rice + pigeon pea (4:1 row  
ratio) and rice + peanut/soybean (4:2 row ratio) have been found promising in NEH  
regions. Intercropping with legumes helps in reducing weed problem, improving  
soil fertility, and enhancing farm income (Das et al. 2012).

3   Rice Production in India                                                               65 

   Under the irrigated medium land situations, the major cropping systems are rice-  
rice,  rice-wheat,  rice-winter  maize,  rice-peanut,  rice-sunflower,  rice-potato,  rice-  
mustard, rice-chickpea, and rice-winter vegetables. The cropping intensity of this  
system is 200 %. However, there is still scope to increase the cropping intensity by  
introducing a third crop of short-duration pulses like cowpea, green gram, black  
gram, or oilseed crops like sesame. This can be possible only in those areas where  
facilities are available to provide 1–2 lifesaving irrigations to the third crop. In West  
Bengal, rice-potato-sesame, rice-wheat-green gram, and rice-wheat-jute are found  
most suitable. While in Punjab conditions, rice-potato-sunflower, rice-potato-winter  
maize,  and  rice-toria-sunflower  have  been  found  to  be  more  productive  than  the  
conventional  system  of  200  %  cropping  intensity  with  rice-wheat  or  rice-winter  
maize (Tiwari et al. 2013). 
   In the rainfed lowland ecosystem, medium to long duration rice varieties of 140– 
155  days  are  usually  grown  in  shallow  lowlands  of  Eastern  India.  Some  short-  
duration crops like green gram and black gram are grown with residual soil moisture  
in harvested rice fields (Saha and Moharana 2005). In intermediate deep and deep- 
water rice ecologies of east coast and lower Gangetic Plains of India, long-duration  
(155–180 days) photosensitive rice varieties can be grown. In these areas, rainwater  
is harvested during the monsoon period of June–September which is used in grow- 
ing several winter vegetables like pumpkin, bitter guard, okra, and chili, along with  
other crops like black gram, green gram, sunflower, peanut, and sesame during the  
dry  season.  Generally,  monocropping  of  rice  is  done  in  the  salt-affected  rainfed  
coastal areas. However, certain salt-tolerant crops like sunflower, chili, watermelon,  
sugar beet, cotton, and barley are grown along with rice, depending on the avail- 
ability of harvested rainwater, soil, and climatic conditions (Singh et al. 2006). 
   For the successful cultivation of rice-based cropping system, it is very important  
to select suitable varieties and adjust the dates of planting. Development of efficient  
rice-based cropping systems for irrigated and rainfed areas and their evaluation in  
respect of their production potential with or without resources constraints per unit  
area per unit time and their long-range effects on improvement of soil health is the  
remedy for increasing rice production (Srivastava and Mahapatra 2012). 

3.5      Varieties and Genetic Improvement 

For the diversity in rice varieties, India is considered one of the richest countries in  
the world (Table  3.4). Several different rice varieties have been reported in India,  
depending on variations in the soil structure, plant characteristics, weather condi- 
tions, and purposes of use. It has been estimated by Dr. R.H. Richharia, one of the  
most outstanding rice scientists of the world, that during the  Vedic period, about  
400,000 varieties of rice existed in India (Thiyagarajan and Gujja 2013). Even now,  
as many as 200,000 rice varieties have been estimated to exist in India.

    Over the last 50 years in tropical Asia, India has released the greatest number  
(643) of varieties. India may therefore be chosen as a case study for evaluating the  
genetic  diversity  of  cultivated  varieties.  In  the  last  30  years,  632  varieties  were  
developed and released for commercial cultivation in India for different ecosystems.  
Of  the  632  varieties,  14  (2.2  %)  for  deepwater,  30  (4.7  %)  for  rainfed  semi-  
deepwater,  33  (5.2  %)  for  hill  ecologies,  87  (13.7  %)  for  rainfed  uplands,  123  
(19.4 %) for rainfed shallow lowlands, and 374 (59 %) were released for the irri- 
gated ecosystem. About 77 % of the total rice area in the country is occupied by  
high-yielding varieties (FAO 2003). As a result of concerted efforts over the last two  
decades, more than 50 hybrids have been released so far. Important hybrids from  
public sector are KRH-2, DRRH-2, and Pusa RH 10 and from private sectors PHB  
71, PA 6201, PA 6444, and PA 6129. The yield advantage of hybrids is in the range  
of 15–20 % over the high-yielding inbreds. However, still area under hybrid rice has  
reached only about 1.5 m ha. Some of the considered reasons for poor adoption of  
hybrid rice technology are (i) lack of hybrid seed availability at reasonable cost and  
weak infrastructure for quality hybrid seed production, (ii) low magnitude of het- 
erosis, (iii) poor grain and cooking quality, (iv) low yield on seed parent resulting  
into  high  seed  cost,  (v)  susceptibility  of  hybrids  to  biotic  stresses  (blight,  blast,  
BPH),  and  (vi)  lack  of  suitable  hybrids  for  fragile  ecosystem  (drought,  salinity,  
submergence, acidity, low temperature). There is a need for mapping of heterotic  
QTLs in promising hybrids and their transfer to breed super parental lines. There is  
also need for utilization of yield enhancing heterotic QTL from land races and wild  
relatives. Improved version of KMR 3, the male parent of KRH 2 carrying heterotic  
gene block from same land races, and O. rufipogon have been developed which are  
likely to enhance the level of heterosis. Development of Pusa RH 10, the first super  
fine grain aromatic rice hybrid has proved that if the parental lines are carefully bred  
and selected, the hybrid with excellent grain and cooking quality can be developed.  
Now several genes conferring resistance to bacterial blight, blast, brown plant hop- 
per  have  been  identified  and  mapped  using  molecular  markers. The  potential  of

3   Rice Production in India                                                                  67 

marker-assisted selection has been amply demonstrated in breeding for resistance to  
bacterial  blight  (BB)  through  development  of  inbreds  PR-124,  Improved  Pusa  
Basmati 1, Punjab Basmati 3, and Improved Samba Mahsuri. The fragile rice eco- 
system  consisting  of  drought,  submergence,  salinity/alkalinity,  acidity,  and  low-  
temperature stress constitutes more than 50 % area under rice in India. Now with the  
availability of tightly linked markers for gene like Sub 1 (Swarna Sub 1) and Saltol  
conferring seedling stage submergence (Pokkali rice) and salinity tolerance (CSR-  
30), it should be possible to incorporate these genes into elite material. Similarly  
genes for phosphorus uptake (Pup 1) and drought tolerance (Sahbaghi Dhan, Dhan  
201, Dhan 202) are now mapped and are being deplored to harness their potential  
through improved lines in stress environment. 
    At  present,  in  28  state  agricultural  universities  (SAUs),  more  than  125  rice  
research stations are working on all aspects of rice. Identification of several varieties  
was done by intensive selection from local population in different parts of India. It  
proved to be the stepping stone for the modern breeding program in which high- and  
stable-yielding   varieties   with   resistance   to   major   diseases   and   insects   were  
developed. 

3.6      Rice Production Methods 

Four rice agroecosystems have been identified and categorized by the International  
Rice Research Institute (IRRI). These are (1) irrigated rice ecosystems, (2) rainfed  
lowland rice ecosystems, (3) upland rice ecosystems, and (4) deepwater rice eco- 
systems. For all these conditions, one set of cultural practices cannot be used effi- 
ciently.  For  example,  transplanting  is  the  main  method  of  rice  establishment  in  
irrigated areas, but in some areas, direct seeding is being done. There are three  
principal systems which have been adopted in India. These are dry system, semidry  
system, and wet system. Soil types, topography of the land, rainfall pattern, etc.,  
are the factors which affect the selection of method to be adopted (Srivastava and  
Mahapatra  2012).  Besides  this,  availability  of  labor  is  also  an  important  factor,  
which affects the choice of establishment method. Thiyagarajan and Gujja (2013)  
found that the source and availability of water are the most important factors which  
finally decide the method of crop establishment in the different ecosystems (Table  
3.5).  There  are  mainly  two  types  of  soils  in  India  in  which  rice  is  grown,  i.e.,  
uplands  and  lowlands.  Broadly,  rice  sowing  methods  can  be  classified  into  two  
methods: 

 (a)  Dry  or  semidry  upland  cultivation.  This  method  is  further  divided  into  two  
     categories: 

      (i)  Broadcasting the seed 
      (ii)  Sowing the seed using a plough or a drill

 (b)  Wet  or  lowland  cultivation.  This  method  also  is  further  divided  into  two  
      categories: 

       (i)  Transplanting in puddled fields 
       (ii)  Broadcasting sprouted seeds in puddled field 

    Broadly speaking, main methods of raising rice crop are direct seeding and trans- 
planting. In case of transplanting, seedlings are raised in the seed bed before they  
are transplanted in the main field, whereas in case of direct seeding, seeds are sown  
straight to the main field either by broadcast seeding or by row seeding in wet or dry  
soil. This is the basic difference between these two methods. 

3.6.1       Direct-Seeded Rice  

The main method of rice establishment in the country is transplanting. But this produc- 
tion  system  is  water,  labor,  and  energy  intensive.  Nowadays,  these  resources  are  
becoming increasingly scarce, so this system is becoming less profitable. This system  
also adversely affects the soil physical properties, thus the performance of succeeding  
upland crops, e.g., wheat, and deteriorates the environment quality by contributing to  
methane emissions. All these factors played an important role to increase in demand  
for shifting from puddled transplanting to direct seeding of rice (DSR) in irrigated rice  
ecosystems (Kumar and Ladha 2011; Mahajan et al. 2012; Chauhan et al. 2012).

    DSR refers to the process of establishing a rice crop from seeds sown in the  
field  rather  than  by  transplanting  seedlings  from  the  nursery.  This  method  is  
mostly adopted in rainfed uplands, medium lands, and lowlands where rainfall is  
uncertain, the topography is undulating, and fields are unbunded. Actually, direct  
seeding is not a new concept; rather it is the oldest method of rice establishment.  
DSR was the most common method before the 1950s but was gradually replaced  
by puddled transplanting (Grigg  1974; Pandey and Velasco 2005). In DSR, there  
are  three  principal  methods:  wet  seeding  (sowing  pre-germinated  seeds  on  wet  
puddled soils), dry seeding (sowing dry seeds into dry soil), and water seeding  
(seeds sown into standing water). All these methods are different form each other  
by different land preparations or by different crop establishment methods or by  
both (Table 3.6). 

3.6.1.1      Direct Seeding on Dry Seed Bed or Dry-Direct Seeded Rice 

In this method, plowing and leveling are done properly before or at the onset of  
monsoon. Rice seeds are directly sown in the field at row spacings of 15–20 cm  
using seed rates of 25–50 kg ha−1 depending on variety and time of planting and are  

covered with soil by shallow tillage or planking (Mahajan et al. 2011; Mahajan and  
Chauhan 2016). In dry DSR, different methods are used, including: 

 1.  Broadcasting of dry seeds on unpuddled soil after either zero tillage or conven- 
    tional tillage 
 2.  Dibbled method in a well-prepared field 
 3.  Drilling of seeds in rows after conventional tillage or reduced tillage using a  
    power tiller-operated seeder 

----------------------- Page 77-----------------------

70                                                                          G. Mahajan et al. 

   A seed-cum-fertilizer drill can be used for DSR in conventional or zero tillage  
which drills the seeds and places the fertilizer simultaneously. The seedbed condi- 
tion in this system is unpuddled and dry, so the aerobic environment is provided to  
seed. Rainfed upland, lowland, and flood-prone areas of Asia are the main regions  
where this method is traditionally practiced (Rao et al. 2007). However, as the water  
scarcity is increasing in irrigated areas also, so this method is gaining importance in  
these areas. In spite of promising benefits from the adoption of dry DSR, farmers  
may not be able to adopt this technology until the problems of cultivation in dry  
DSR is solved and the technologies are fine-tuned to suit farmers’ conditions. 
   Adoption of dry DSR on a large scale is possible; however, public-private part- 
nerships and prioritizing resources are the key to success. To achieve success in dry  
DSR, precise laser- leveled fields, drills having improved seed metering systems,  
and trained tractor drivers and pesticide operators are the key components. The sow- 
ing of DSR at shallow depth is important for good establishment. Short-duration  
cultivars, hybrids, and basmati rice gave superior performance under dry seeding,  
but breeding rice cultivars for dry seeding is the important thrust area for further  
productivity gains in dry DSR (Mahajan et al. 2015). Weeds pose a serious problem  
in dry DSR for high productivity. Pre- and postemergence herbicide applications are  
needed for effective weed management; however, the choice of herbicides varies  
according to dominant weed flora (Mahajan et al.  2009, 2015). For effective and  
sustainable management of weeds in dry DSR and for delaying herbicide resistance  
in weeds, integrated weed management strategies are needed in dry DSR. Effective  
weed management in dry DSR starts from the timing and method of land prepara- 
tion, choice of herbicides relative to the dominant weed species and soil moisture at  
the time of application, and the effect of weather on weeds and during herbicide  
application. 

3.6.1.2    Direct Seeding on Puddled Seedbed or Wet Direct-Seeded Rice 

In wet direct seeding method, field is puddled by repeated plowing and laddering in  
standing water. The mud is then leveled, and the excess water is drained to ensure  
good establishment of seedlings. Then, the pre-germinated seeds are sown with a  
radicle varying in size from 1 to 3 mm on or into puddle soil. These seeds are either  
broadcast by hand or sown in line using a drum seeder at the seeding rate of 80–  
100 kg ha−1. This method is further classified into two categories, i.e., aerobic wet-  

seeded rice and anaerobic wet-seeded rice. In aerobic wet-seeded rice, pre-germinated  
seeds are sown on the surface of puddled soil, so the seed environment becomes  
aerobic. When pre-germinated seeds are sown/drilled into puddled soil, the seed  
environment is mostly anaerobic, hence known as anaerobic wet direct-seeded rice.  
In both aerobic and anaerobic methods, seeds are either broadcast or sown in line  
using an anaerobic seeder with a furrow opener and closer (Balasubramanian and  
Hill 2002) or a drum seeder (Rashid et al. 2009; Khan et al. 2009).

3.6.1.3     Water Seeding 

In this method, seeds are water soaked and incubated for 24 h, and then these pre-  
germinated seeds are broadcasted in standing water on puddled soils, and this pro- 
cess  is  known  as  wet-water  seeding.  When  these  pre-germinated  seeds  are  
broadcasted in standing water on unpuddled soil, process is known as dry-water  
seeding (Kumar and Ladha 2011). Seeds sink in the standing water getting a good  
anchorage. Those rice varieties are most suitable for water seeding which are toler- 
ant  to  a  low  level  of  dissolved  oxygen,  lowlight,  and  other  stress  environments  
(Balasubramanian and Hill 2002). Besides irrigated areas, water seeding is popular  
in those areas also, where chances of early flood occurrence are more and drainage  
of excess water become difficult task in that fields. 

3.6.2      Transplanted Rice 

It is the most elaborate method of cultivation of rice in the country. It is clear from  
the name of method that seed is sown in one place and the seedlings are transplanted  
to another after specific growth. This method is practiced to ensure higher yields  
and less weed problem. It is practiced in those areas where irrigation facilities are  
available or where water is not a limiting factor. First, the seedlings are raised in a  
nursery, and then 4–6-week-old seedlings are transplanted into puddled fields with  
standing water. Transplanting gives the rice crop a head start over emerging weeds  
and ensures a uniform plant stand (Chauhan et al.  2012; Thiyagarajan and Gujja  
2013). Transplanting may also allow crop intensification as the crop remains for less  
time in the field. Transplanting shortens the duration of the crop in the main field,  
thus providing opportunity to the farmers to accommodate rice crop to an uncertain  
and finite water supply. This provides the ability to farmers to make adjustments in  
the planting dates in response to water availability. 
   In transplanting method, internal structure of soils is broken down by puddling;  
thus, water loss through percolation is reduced and water holding capacity in the  
surface layer of soil is increased by development of a plow pan or hard layer. This  
is the way how utility of limited water is extended in transplanting systems (Maclean  
et al. 2002). Raising of nursery is the prerequisite for this system. The agronomic  
techniques involved are raising healthy wet nursery and transplanting in the main  
field with optimum population. Generally, nursery is raised on an area of 8–10 % of  
the total area for transplanting. Seedlings can be raised in wet or dry nursery beds,  
depending upon water availability. A new approach for nursery raising, called dapog  
method, and in this method a thick stand of seedlings is raised in plastic sheets  
 without  any  contact  with  soil.  This  technique  was  developed  in  the  Philippines  
(Thiyagarajan and Gujja 2013). Transplanting method is further divided into two  
categories, i.e., manual transplanting and mechanical transplanting.

3.6.2.1     Manual Transplanting 

Manual transplanting is the most widely used method in India for transplanting  
of rice. Costly machines are not required in this method, so it is most suited for  
labor- surplus  areas  and  for  small  rice  fields.  For  manual  transplanting,  any  
method of nursery raising, viz., wet, dry, or mat type, can be used. Manual trans- 
planting of seedlings is very much practiced in irrigation command rice areas of  
the  country.  No  doubt,  it  gives  uniform  crop  stand;  it  is  quite  expensive  and  
requires  a  lot  of  labor  besides  involving  a  lot  of  drudgery  (Manjunatha  et  al.  
2009). Depending on soil type, 1 ha of rice requires 25–30 person days to estab- 
lish.  Manual  transplanting  is  done  either  at  random  or  in  straight  rows  (Rice  
Knowledge Bank 2015a). 

Random Method 

Seedlings are transplanted without any definite row arrangement in this method. By  
manual transplanting method, equal distances between hills are difficult to deter- 
mine. But it must be ensured that the estimated distances should not be too close or  
too wide as compared to the recommended spacing. 

Straight-Row Method 

In this method, a uniform spacing between plants is maintained. The seedlings are  
transplanted in straight rows. The optimum plant spacing is 20 × 10 cm or 20 × 15 cm  
under normal conditions, but it can be slightly narrower, i.e., 15 × 10 cm under  
subnormal conditions (Meera et al. 2014b). In the straight row transplanting method,  
application of herbicides, fertilizers, or insecticides and management practices such  
as hand or rotary weeding are very easy to be practiced. 

3.6.2.2     Mechanical Transplanting 

Mechanical transplanting of rice is the method of transplanting young rice seed- 
lings, which have been grown in a mat nursery, by using a self-propelled rice trans- 
planter. It is the most promising option for rice transplanting as it ensures timely  
transplanting, saves labor, and attains optimum plant density that ultimately contrib- 
utes  to  high  yield  (Manjunatha  et  al.  2009;  Manes  et  al.  2013).  In  conventional  
manual transplanting practice, for transplanting one acre, 8–12 laborers are required.  
However, only three people can transplant up to four acres in a day by using a self-  
propelled rice transplanter (Rickman et al. 2015). Kamboj et al. (2013) revealed that  
rice can be easily grown by mechanical transplanting method under non-puddled  
and  no-till  conditions  with  yield  advantages  over  the  conventional  puddled

transplanting  system.  For  mechanical  transplanting  method,  mat-type  method  is  
used for nursery raising. In mat-type nursery, rice seedlings are raised on a thin  
layer of soil and farm yard manure (FYM) or compost mixture placed on a poly- 
thene sheet (Rickman et al. 2015). 

3.7      Major Production Constraints 

Though India has its own position in the world for rice area and production, yet it  
is still counted in the countries with the lowest rice yields. Rice yield has been  
reported lower than the national average yield in about 70 % of the 414 rice-grow- 
ing districts of the country (Srivastava and Mahapatra 2012). It clearly shows that  
even after the implication of high-yield technology, a sizable area of the country is  
categorized as low producing. Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha, Assam, West Bengal, and  
Uttar Pradesh occupy 60 % area of low rice-producing states. Even in the irrigated  
rice areas, also, 32 % area produces less than the average yield. As compared to  
China and Egypt, where yields are 6.1 and 8.3 t ha−1, respectively, India’s yields in  
irrigated fields are too low, i.e., 4.2 tons paddy ha−1 (Tiwari  2002). It has been  

revealed in the yield gap analysis that we achieve 30–40 % less yield than that of  
the potential yield which is achievable by using the available high-yielding culti- 
vars on high productivity irrigated land. The major reasons for this gap are the  
degraded and less fertile soils, pockets of endemic pests and diseases, defects in  
cropping systems, low input use, and less adoption of high-yielding technology  
(Srivastava and Mahapatra 2012). 
   Although it is a well-recognized fact that the key to India’s sustained food secu- 
rity lies in the rice-producing region, still we have inadequate understanding of the  
production constraints which tend to reduce yield and factor productivity in rice  
farming. In the past, several studies have been conducted to examine the production  
constraints at the farm level (Mahapatra 1995; Siddiq 1996). The Indian Council of  
Agricultural  Research  (ICAR)  in  1987  had  undertaken  the  “Special  Research  to  
Development   Programme.”   Similarly,   the   Ministry   of  Agriculture   conducted  
“Special Rice Production Programme” and “Front Line Demonstration” since 1990.  
But India is still lagging behind to make strategies to remove them. 
   The problems and constraints faced by the farmers in rice production vary, not  
only from state to state but also from area to area. The eastern region is the major  
rice-growing region of the country, and almost every year, this region has to face the  
problem of high rainfall and severe flood. However, in the upland ecology, either  
high rainfall or drought situations cause the yield reduction. Besides this, desired  
yield response to the balanced application of fertilizers cannot be achieved due to  
some  soil-related  problems  in  some  specific  regions.  Nonavailability  of  quality  
seeds of suitable high-yielding varieties is also a big constraint in rice production in  
some areas. A list of major constraints in different states or agroecologies is given  
by CRRI (2011) (Table 3.7).

    The  main  problems  and  constraints  for  rice  production  in  India  have  been  
grouped into three categories (Thanh and Singh 2006). These are: 

 1.  Agroecological constraints 
 2.  Technical constraints 
 3.  Socioeconomic constraints 

3.7.1       Agroecological Constraints  

Analysis on the agroecological constraints revealed that Indian farmers face five  
main   problems   or   constraints   in   rice   production   (Thanh   and   Singh   2006).  
Dependence of farmers on the monsoon is the foremost production constrains in  
India. Sowing of rice crop in West Bengal regions is dependent mostly on monsoon,  
and almost all farmers grow only one crop per year due to this problem. Land or soil  
problem is also considered as the major rice production constraint. Uneven topog- 
raphy, waterlogging, degraded land/soil, soil salinity, and lack of fertility are the  
main factors which cause the land constraints. Environment pollution, lack of water  
for irrigation, and small land holding are the other important agroecological rice  
production constraints. 

3.7.2        Technical Constraints 

The results of technological constraints analysis revealed that Indian farmers per- 
ceived 11 technical constraints (Thanh and Singh 2006). Major rice diseases, viz.,  
blast, sheath blight, stem rot, and pests, viz., stem borer, are considered as major

3   Rice Production in India                                                                75 

constraints in rice production. Lack of proper cultivars, postharvest technologies,  
and  storage  facilities  cause  the  reduction  in  rice  production  and  productivity  in  
many regions of India. For example, in many regions of West Bengal, even now the  
farmers  use  traditional  low-yielding  cultivars  and  traditional  manual  methods  of  
postharvest technology. Low price of rice produce, less availability and high price  
of fertilizers, plant protection and weed problems, lack of skilled labor, and poor  
processing  facilities  are  the  other  technical  constraints  for  Indian  rice-producing  
farmers. 

3.7.3      Socioeconomic Constraints 

The  most  important  socioeconomic  constraint  is  the  poor  infrastructures  like  
nonavailability of transporting facilities and problems of poor road for trans- 
portation (Thanh and Singh 2006). Production cost of rice is increasing day by  
day due to increase in the price of important inputs such as herbicides, fertiliz- 
ers,  insecticides,  fungicides,  fuels  and  electricity  charges  for  irrigation,  etc.,  
which  led  to  decrease  in  net  profits.  Besides  this,  inadequate  inputs,  lack  of  
trainings, credit problems, poor extension services, and lack of support from  
local  governments  are  also  considered  as  socioeconomic  constraints  for  rice  
productions. 
    Barker ( 1979) classified the constraints to high yields into two categories: those  
that affect the crop potential under a farmer’s environment and those that affect a  
farmer’s  ability  and  willingness  to  achieve  the  potential  yield  on  the  farm.  Rice  
productivity in different growing zones is affected adversely due to all these prob- 
lems/constraints. According to Mahapatra ( 1994), different production constraints  
can be classified into six broad categories: 

 (a)  Biophysical constraints 
 (b)  Technological constraints 
 (c)  Administrative constraints 
 (d)  Institutional constraints 
 (e)  Procedural constraints 
 (f)  Socioeconomic constraints 

   Widawsky and O’Toole ( 1996), by including rice biotechnology programs, clas- 
sified  the  constraints  into  biotic  and  abiotic  constraints. Thus,  the  factors  which  
restrict the adoption of improved technologies and attainment of potential yield may  
be biotic and abiotic, or technical and socioeconomic, or combinations of these.  
There is a need to make a multidisciplinary approach for solving these constraints  
as these factors are intertwined with each other. 
    Besides these constraints, a new challenge of climate change and its conse- 
quences are expected to be a big problem in future to achieve a high productivity  
of rice. There is a need to formulate the agricultural research in such a way that  
the constraints are converted into opportunities, not only for increasing the rice  
production  but  also  for  providing  food  security  to  the  poor  farmers  of  the  
country.

3.8      Challenges and Opportunities 

3.8.1      Challenges 

Total rice area in the country is 44 million hectare, out of which, 18.8 million  
hectare is under rainfed conditions and 67 % of that lies in the Eastern India  
only (Mohapatra et al. 2013). The challenges may include land fragmentation/ 
degradation, water scarcity, shifting of labor to other sectors, declining profit  
margin, increasing cultivation cost, distress sale, ensuring nutritional and food  
security to the people lying below poverty line, lack of infrastructure for stor- 
age,  intellectual  property  regime,  postharvest  losses,  and  emerging  environ- 
mental issues in areas of intensive agriculture. The detailed information about  
the major challenges for rice production has been given below (Mohapatra et al.  
2013). 

3.8.1.1    Land Scenario 

Population is increasing at an alarming rate in India, so, per capita total land avail- 
ability is reducing (Mohapatra et al. 2013). In 2001, total land availability per capita  
was 0.32 ha in India as compared to the world average of 2.19 ha. But it is estimated  
to be decreased to 0.23 ha in 2025 and 0.19 ha in 2050. Area is shifting from agri- 
cultural to nonagricultural uses over the years, so area under nonagricultural uses is  
increasing. Because of the fast growth of industrialization, urbanization, and the  
population, farmers have been encouraged to exploit marginal lands for rice cultiva- 
tion. This cultivation of rice on marginal lands like acid soils, tidal lands, forest  
lands, etc., limits the rice yield. 

3.8.1.2    Soil-Related Challenges 

Deterioration of Soil Quality 

At the farm as well as at the ecosystem level, the quality of Indian soils is being  
deteriorated gradually (Mohapatra et al. 2013). Loss of organic carbon, erosion,  
nutrient imbalance, compaction, salinization, waterlogging, decline in soil bio- 
diversity, urbanization, and contamination with heavy metals and pesticides are  
the major challenges to the soil quality in the country. Defective farming prac- 
tices like increased use of machinery, permanent waterlogging and rice mono- 
culture,  continuous  soil  puddling  and  submergence,  injudicious  use  of  inputs  
(fertilizer, pesticides), excessive use for irrigation, and contamination of under- 
ground water with toxic industrial wastes in rice cultivation cause the deteriora- 
tion of the soil quality.

3   Rice Production in India                                                                 77 

Excessive Mining of Soil 

With the introduction of improved rice varieties, soil mining has become a big chal- 
lenge in rice-producing regions (Mohapatra et al.  2013). Improved rice varieties  
have  the  ability  to  exhaust  soil  fertility  more  rapidly  as  compared  to  traditional  
varieties.  On  an  average,  for  the  production  of  one  ton  of  rough  rice  (paddy),  
20 kg N, 11 kg P O , 30 kg K O, 3 kg S, 7 kg Ca, 3 kg Mg, 150 g Fe, 675 g Mn, 40 g 2 5 2 
Zn, 18 g Cu, 15 g B, 2 g Mo, and 52 kg Si are removed by rice crop from soil.  
However, only macronutrients in the form of fertilizers are applied to soil, while  
some essential micro- and secondary nutrients are neglected. Thus, in the long run,  
deficiency of the microelements has been emerging causing an imbalance in soil  
nutrient status and adversely affecting the grain yield. 

3.8.1.3     Water-Related Challenges 

About 55 % of the areas cultivated to rice are under irrigation in India. In the com- 
ing years, due to spatial and temporal variations, increasing competition of water  
among different sectors coupled with the climate change (high evaporation, con- 
tinuous droughts), water-related challenges are going to be broadened. The success  
of rice crop primarily depends on the availability of water. The major water-related  
challenges in the country are the following. 

Decreasing Availability of Water 

It has been estimated that about 22 % of the geographic area and 17 % of the popu- 
lation will be under absolute water scarcity by 2050 (Mohapatra et al. 2013). The  
per capita water availability is projected to be 1235 cubic meters in 2050 as com- 
pared to 1704 cubic meters in 2010. As the demand for drinking and industrial water  
as well as for the energy sector is increasing, the availability of water for agriculture,  
especially for rice cultivation, will decrease substantially. 

Water Use Efficiency 

Water is considered as the most important input for rice cultivation. It is a well-  
known fact that for producing 1 kg of rice, 2500–3500 l of water are used in many  
areas (Mohapatra et al. 2013). However, more amount of water is being used in the  
states like Punjab and Haryana, to produce the same quantity of rice. So, there is a  
need to make strategies to increase the water use efficiency. This has prompted the  
respective state governments to issue advisory to avoid transplanting rice during the  
period of high evaporative demand (May–June). The genetic improvement in rice  
plant to improve water use efficiency has become a challenge, and it needs strategic

interventions. The recent study of Sharda et al. (2016) on use of solar-operated drip  
irrigation in direct-seeded rice has shown that drip irrigation in rice can bring three- 
fold transformation in cultivating rice in South Asia with high water-, energy-, and  
nutrient-use efficiency while ensuring the food and livelihood security. This was the  
first study on drip irrigation in rice in South Asia and in future policy might be tilted  
toward promotion of use of such type of system in rice for water saving. 

Deterioration of Water Quality 

In the last two decades, water quality has become a serious concern (Mohapatra  
et al. 2013). Saline water intrusion and injudicious use of fertilizers and pesticides  
are the major factors which caused deterioration of groundwater quality with high  
arsenic, iron, and fluoride content. It is estimated that in the coming years, water  
quality would further decline with the increased rate of urbanization, industrializa- 
tion, and overexploitation of natural resources. 

3.8.1.4    Widening Yield Gap and Stagnation of Yield 

The yield gap is the gap between the research station yield and actual farm yield.  
The yield gap derived as the percent difference between achievable (experimental)  
and average farmer’s yield in India reveals that the bridgeable gap is quite wide,  
even though some reduction has been reported recently. It is in the range of 35–75 %  
in  the  country  with  the  exceptions  of  Tamil  Nadu  (15  %)  and  Punjab  (22  %)  
(Srivastava and Mahapatra 2012). In the eastern states, yield gap is higher than other  
regions. 
   Moreover, yield stagnation has been reached in the irrigated region of northwest  
India  where  favorable  climatic  conditions  such  as  high  solar  radiation,  long  day  
length, and low night temperature exist. Though yield gap has been reduced by the  
interventions of modern varieties coupled with improved agronomic practices in  
recent years, bridging the yield gap would not be easy because of the diversity pre- 
vailing in the country in agroecological and socioeconomic conditions (Mohapatra  
et al. 2013). 

3.8.1.5    Biotic Stresses 

Due to the introduction of modern semidwarf varieties and increased use of nitrogen  
fertilizers and insecticides, biotic challenges have been increased in the country. In  
relation to the economic losses to the crops, the status of pests like stem borers,  
brown plant hoppers, and leaf folders and diseases such as bacterial blight, blast,  
and sheath rot has changed from low to high (Mohapatra et al. 2013). It is estimated  

----------------------- Page 86-----------------------

3   Rice Production in India                                                               79 

that due to climate change and increased use of chemicals, the pest scenario will be  
very different by 2050 from today’s scenario (Mohapatra et al. 2013). The occur- 
rence of insects-pests and diseases, which were considered minor in the past, is  
increasing these days. Therefore, there is a challenge for the scientists to minimize  
losses due to these stresses by developing tolerant varieties and sustainable manage- 
ment practices. 

3.8.1.6     Climate Change/Variability 

Potential negative impacts of the climate change such as increased CO  and tem-2 
perature, deficit or excess rainfall, and rise in sea level are expected on rice varieties  
and  farming  practices  (Mohapatra  et  al.  2013).  It  has  been  confirmed  from  the  
researches that there is a positive effect of elevated CO  level on rice production 2 
(Mohapatra et al. 2013). However, the associated events, such as altered patterns of  
rainfall, rise in temperatures, and possibly increased events of drought and floods,  
may increase production risks and affect the rice yield adversely. The rise in tem- 
perature may not be a real challenge for rice in India. Rather, the extreme events of  
climate change such as floods, drought, and cyclones and other related problems  
such as salinity pose the real challenge to rice in India. 

3.8.1.7     Rice Quality 

In the wake of climate change, physical, chemical, and nutritional quality charac- 
teristics are more likely to be negatively influenced by the environmental factors  
(salinity, drought, and temperature extremes) (Mohapatra et al. 2013). So improv- 
ing and maintaining the quality characteristics of rice is an important challenge in  
the future. However, it is estimated that the consumer will be more informative  
and health conscious with a higher purchasing capacity by 2050. Therefore, in the  
future,  preference  for  nutrient-rich  and  good  cooking  quality  rice  will  be  
increased. 

3.8.1.8     Lack of Mechanization 

The current level of the average farm power availability is 1.7 kW ha−1, which needs  
to be increased to at least 3.0 kW ha−1 for timely and quality operation in heavy  

fields (Mohapatra et al. 2013). The main problem for mechanization in India is the  
fragmentation of land holding which is not suitable for adoption of machineries and  
difficulty in consolidation of land holdings. Due to disaggregation of the joint fam- 
ily system, an increase in land fragmentation is expected. Thus, inadequacy of farm  
power and machinery is a big challenge for rice production in India.

3.8.1.9     Environmental Problems 

Production of methane gas is the foremost serious problem in flooded rice produc- 
tion systems (Mohapatra et al. 2013). Besides this, problems of groundwater deple- 
tion,  waterlogging,  salinity  and  alkalinity,  greenhouse  gas  emission,  and  water  
pollution are also caused by the irrigated rice in India as well as other parts of the  
world. The excessive use of agrochemicals in rice production may cause these prob- 
lems and, thus, health hazards through drained water. 

3.8.2      Opportunities 

India has the first and second position in area and production of rice in the world,  
respectively. Though modern varieties and advanced agronomic practices have been  
developed in the country, there are still huge gaps between actual yield obtained by  
farmers and the potential yield (CRRI 2011). It is estimated that postharvest losses  
are about 20–30 %. Nitrogen fertilizer or water utilization efficiencies remain varied  
between 30 and 50 % that can be increased by developing good management prac- 
tices.  Therefore,  the  priorities  are  given  to  narrowing  yield  and  efficiency  gaps,  
valuing addition to cropping or farming systems, and reducing postharvest losses to  
increase rice production and farmers’ net profit while keeping the environment safe. 
    Knowledge in rice functional genomics for precise trait modification is still very  
limited in India. It makes the task difficult for manipulation of the traits precisely for  
gaining maximum economic benefits as the important traits are mostly of geneti- 
cally complex nature (Mohapatra et al. 2013). Recent scientific advances in marker-  
assisted  breeding  and  genomics  have  made  the  way  for  exploiting  gene  bank  
materials  at  large  scale  for  identifying  and  embedding  the  genes  responsible  for  
more complicated target traits. There are many stresses such as biotic and abiotic  
and their combination and nutritional factors, which limit the crop yields. These  
multiple environmental stresses cannot be removed by a single approach. So the  
development of a resilient set of new germplasm which can better adapt to the stress  
environments is needed. It is feasible to identify and pyramid stress tolerance mul- 
tiple genes in high-yielding genotype background and would be practicable for tai- 
loring novel rice varieties in future. 
    It is expected that in the coming decades, hybrid rice can give a quantum jump to  
overall rice production in India (Mohapatra et al. 2013). Some progress in hybrid  
rice  in  irrigated  areas  of  subhumid  to  semiarid  regions  has  already  been  made.  
However, there is a need to enhance the yield through increasing magnitude of het- 
erosis and introgression of known disease and pest tolerance genes in the parents.  
Hybrids  for  rainfed  lowland  ecosystems  of  high  rainfall  regions  also  need  to  be  
developed. Under such situations, there is a need to increase the yield potential of  
hybrids by improving the magnitude of heterosis by developing suitable parental  
lines. Besides this, grain protein and micronutrient contents in rice can be improved

3   Rice Production in India                                                                              81 

by using conventional and modern biotechnological approaches by utilizing exist- 
ing genetic variability. It is necessary because in spite of having a remarkable prog- 
ress for rice production in the country, malnutrition due to micronutrient, protein,  
and calorie deficiency is still a problem among the poor population in rural areas  
(Mohapatra et al. 2013). 
    Identification of superior alleles and bioprospecting novel genes for abiotic and  
biotic  stress  tolerance,  resource  use  efficiency,  nutritional  quality,  male  sterility/ 
fertility restoration, and yield traits are the main focus of rice research during the  
current scenario. There is a huge potential for increasing the rice productivity by  
developing C  rice. It is expected that genes present in C  species can be recruited 4 3 
into  cell-specific  functions  in  the  C   pathway  without  alterations  to  their  gene 4 
sequence. Transgenic technologies are likely to be used to engineer N -fixing rice 2 
and new rice plants that have a new photosynthetic pathway. 
    Conservation agriculture has potential to increase and sustain the crop productiv- 
ity (Mohapatra et al. 2013). Conservation agriculture will become a common and an  
easy  practice  in  the  coming  days  because  of  development  of  third-  and  fourth-  
generation machinery. This type of machinery performs multiple functions includ- 
ing residue incorporation/retention, sowing, and fertilizer application with the help  
of different sensors and GIS platform. 

3.9       Fertilizer and Pest Management 

3.9.1       Fertilizer Management  

Like any other crop, rice also requires all the 16 essential elements for its growth  
and completion of life cycle. Farmers usually use chemical fertilizers for macronu- 
trients only to compensate the nutritional losses, while loss of some essential sec- 
ondary and micronutrients is neglected. Results of the long-term rice-based cropping  
system experiments conducted on different agroecological regions revealed that the  
continuous and indiscriminate use of inorganic nitrogen fertilizer leads to long- and  
short-term deterioration, influencing the sustainability of rice due to deficiencies of  
macro- and micronutrients like S, Mg, Mn, and Zn (Thiyagarajan and Gujja 2013). 
    Integrated nutrient management (INM) is an approach that aims to increase agri- 
cultural  production  and  safeguard  the  environment  for  future  generations.  INM  
approach involves the use of both organic and inorganic plant nutrients for achiev- 
ing high crop productivity, preventing soil degradation, and also helps in meeting  
future food supply needs. The main aim of INM is to improve soil health and sustain  
a high level of productivity and production (Prasad et al. 1995). 
    Panda et al. (2007) found that higher crop productivity and a more favorable bal- 
ance of nutrients in the soil can be maintained by applying combined NPK fertiliz- 
ers at optimum levels in balanced proportions on the basis of soil test along with  
FYM at 5–10 t ha−1 year−1 to kharif rice in multiple cropping systems as compared  

----------------------- Page 89-----------------------

82                                                                                    G. Mahajan et al. 

to N, NP, or even NPK fertilizers. Besides the FYM, other sources of nutrition like  
incorporation of residues of cereal crops; green manuring with  Sesbania or dual-  
purpose grain legumes like green gram, black gram, or cowpea; and biofertilizers  
such as blue-green algae, Azolla , Azospirillum , Azotobacter , etc., have shown prom- 
ise in improving soil health and crop productivity. So all these sources can substitute  
a part of the recommended dose of chemical N fertilizer, without affecting the crop  
yield. Panda et al. (2004) suggested some INM practices for different rice ecosys- 
tems which can increase rice yield significantly and improve soil fertility. In uplands,  
75 % of optimum NPK + 5 ton FYM + green gram/black gram intercrop as green  
manure between the paired rows of rice has been suggested. In medium lands/irri- 
gated rice, 50–75  % NPK + 5 ton FYM ha−1 + in situ  Sesbania/sunhemp green  

manuring  and,  in  shallow  lowland  rice,  Sesbania  green  manuring  supplemented  
with N topdressing have been suggested for improving rice productivity and soil  
conditions. 
    Site-specific nutrient management (SSNM) for sustaining rice production is a  
novel approach which involves science-based principles for guiding the judicious  
and efficient application of fertilizers as and when needed by crops. Inherent spatial  
variability  associated  with  fields  during  crop  production  are  recognized  by  this  
approach and thus provides the guidelines for optimal use of indigenous nutrients  
originating from soil, plant residues, manures, and irrigation water (Satyanarayana  
et al.  2011). Instead of reducing or increasing the fertilizer use, the main aim of  
SSNM is to apply nutrients at the optimal rate and time in order to achieve high rice  
yield and high nutrient use efficiency (Buresh et al. 2005). For the implementation  
of SSNM in rice crop, early applications at 14 DAT or 21 DAS of N, P, and K are  
done, adjusted to plant need. Subsequent topdressing of N is done on the basis of  
plant’s need as determined with the leaf color chart (LCC) and application of K  
adjusted to plant need at early panicle initiation. The SSNM approach, in which  
determination of nitrogen fertilizer needs through use of the LCC and determination  
of fertilizer P and K needs through use of nutrient omission plot technique, can  
consistently increase grain yield and profit in farmer’s fields (Swarup et al. 2008). 
    The  common  fertilizer  dose  cannot  be  recommended  for  different  regions,  
because in different agroclimatic zones, soil fertility status varies to a considerable  
extent. Therefore, keeping in view the variation in soil fertility and local conditions,  
agricultural  departments  of  various  states  and  state  agricultural  universities  have  
formulated fertilizer recommendations for rice crop in respective states. 

3.9.2      Pest Management  

Until now, more than 100 species of insects as the pest of rice have been reported in  
India. Of these pest species, a dozen are of economic significance. A yield loss of  
about  1  t  ha−1  can  be  averted  if  these  insect  pests  are  not  controlled  effectively  

(Pasalu et al.  2008). Pasalu et al. (2004) found that leaf folder, leafhoppers, and  
plant hoppers which were of minor importance have now gained the status of major  

----------------------- Page 90-----------------------

3   Rice Production in India                                                                          83 

rice pests. Other pests, viz., whorl maggot, rice hispa, green leafhopper, gundhi bug,  
and thrips, are considered as the minor pests of rice crop (Pasalu et al. 2008). Gall  
midge has become a serious pest in many areas and has also extended its activity to  
dry season, particularly in the coastal areas. In Punjab and Haryana, stem borer was  
not known earlier, but now it is considered as a deadly pest in these states. Sporadic  
pests like ear-cutting caterpillar, rice hispa, and gundhi bug have been causing seri- 
ous damage to rice (Pasalu et al. 2004). 
    Dhaliwal  and Arora  ( 1993)  reported  that  pests  cause  25  %  loss  in  rice  crop.  
However, Pasalu et al. (2004) estimated the yield losses ranging from 21 to 51 %  
due to moderate to serious incidence of plant hoppers, stem borer, gall midge, and  
other sporadic pests in the rice-growing regions of the country. Assessment of losses  
in rice crop was analyzed at 135 multilocation trails under the All India Coordinated  
Rice Improvement Project which revealed that the losses due to insect pests are  
28.8 % (Pasalu et al. 2008). 
    Different approaches have been developed for controlling the insect pests. These  
are host plant resistance, cultural control, chemical control, use of botanical pesti- 
cides, biological control, use of biopesticides, insect sex pheromones, etc. As rice is  
grown in different agroecosystems, the conditions of climate, soil, and seasons vary  
under  each  zone.  Hence,  the  pattern  of  insect  infestation  differs  from  region  to  
region and from season to season. 
    To tackle these problems, the best strategy is to adopt an integrated pest manage- 
ment (IPM) approach. The development of suitable IPM strategies is necessary to  
overcome the insect pest constraints for realizing yield potential of rice. A frame- 
work for integrated knowledge, skill, and information on rice pest management is  
provided by rice IPM. Regular pest monitoring, research on the optimal use of pes- 
ticide, complimentary weed control strategies, and alternative cultural and biologi- 
cal controls are included in an IPM approach (Prakash et al. 2014). 

3.10       Harvesting and Yield 

Harvesting is the process of collecting the mature rice crop from the field. Paddy  
harvesting  activities  include  cutting,  stacking,  handling,  threshing,  cleaning,  and  
hauling. 

3.10.1       Harvesting Time  

The most suitable time of harvesting is when panicles turn into golden yellow and  
the grains contain about 20 % moisture (DRD 2014). A heavy loss of crop occurs  
due to shattering of grains and damage by birds and rodents if moisture content in  
the paddy grains reaches 16–17 % in the standing crop in the fields. When 80 % of  
the panicles become straw colored and 20 % grains in lower portions are in the hard

84                                                                                    G. Mahajan et al. 

dough stage, the crop is ready to harvest (Expert System for Paddy 2015). Optimum  
time of harvesting has been specified by the extensive studies. The results of the  
various studies revealed that right time of harvesting can be specified on the basis of  
three criteria, viz., (i) the moisture content of the grains, (ii) the dry matter of the  
plant  or  seed,  and  (iii)  the  number  of  days  after  planting  or  flowering  (Rice  
Knowledge Bank 2015b). 

3.10.2       Methods of Harvesting  

Nearly 15–20 days after 50 % flowering, the grains in the lowest portion of the  
panicles are in the dough stage, irrigation is stopped to the crop, and grains are  
allowed to harden. Depending on the amount of mechanization and the size of oper- 
ation, rice can be harvested manually or mechanically. The manual harvesting is  
mainly practiced in developing countries, while in the developed countries, mechan- 
ical harvesting using reaper windrower, reaper binder, combine harvester, stripper  
harvester, etc., are practiced. However, during the past decade, mechanical harvest- 
ing has become popular in India. The different harvesting systems are discussed  
below (Rice Knowledge Bank 2015b): 

3.10.2.1      Manual Harvesting and Threshing 

Manual harvesting is a traditional method in which long stalks are cut by sickle  
about 10–15 cm above the ground. Depending on the sociocultural acceptance of  
the harvesting labor, there are many variations in the sickle design. For 2 or 3 days,  
the stalks are laid in small bundles on the stubble to dry their panicles. In manual  
harvesting, traditional threshing tools such as simple treadle threshers or threshing  
racks are utilized. Manual harvesting also make use of animals for trampling or by  
hand using sharp sickles or knives. Grain recovery in manual harvesting method is  
about 55–60 % (Expert System for Paddy 2015). 

3.10.2.2      Manual Harvesting and Mechanical Threshing 

Rice is harvested manually, and then cleaning is done with a machine thresher. In  
mechanical threshing, usually the portable thresher is used. Because of high labor  
requirements of manual threshing, it has been replaced by small stationary machine  
threshers. Stationary threshing is generally done in the field or near to the field. 

3.10.2.3      Machine Reaping and Machine Threshing 

The crop is cut and then laid in a line by a reaper. Threshing is done by a thresher,  
and cleaning can be performed either manually or by machine.

3.10.2.4     Combine Harvesting 

All operations are combined in combine harvesters like crop cutting and its feeding  
into threshing mechanism, threshing, cleaning, and discharge of grain into a trolley  
or directly into the bags. Straw is usually discharged behind the combine in a wind- 
row. It gives about 50 % recovery (Expert System for Paddy 2015). 
   There are a number of factors which affect the selection of appropriate harvest- 
ing system (Rice Knowledge Bank 2015b). These are the availability of labor, capi- 
tal outlay of the farm, availability of time, field layout and accessibility of machines,  
lodging characters rice varieties, the demand for quality rice, and the demand for  
straw. 

3.11      Threshing and Processing 

3.11.1       Threshing 

Paddy threshing is the process in which paddy kernels or grains are detached from  
the  panicles  through  rubbing  action,  impact,  and  stripping. Threshing  should  be  
done  immediately  after  harvesting  to  maintain  the  high  quality  of  the  harvested  
grains. Grain quality is affected adversely by field drying and stacking for several  
days due to overdrying. The rubbing action occurs when paddy is threshed by tram- 
pling  by  humans,  animals,  or  tractors.  If  threshing  is  done  by  carelessness,  the  
potential yield of rice crop is reduced to a great extent. This occurred when good  
grains  are  allowed  to  remain  on  the  panicles  or  due  to  grain  scattering  during  
improper threshing. Threshing can be done either manually or by using machines  
(Expert System for Paddy 2015). 

3.11.1.1     Manual Threshing 

Manual threshing is a common method. In this method, separating of grain from the  
panicle is done by treading, hand beating, or holding the crop against a rotating  
drum with rasp bars or spikes. Hand beating methods are used for threshing of rice  
when  grains  from  panicles  tend  to  be  easily  shattered.  Hand  threshing  methods  
include the trampling or foot threshing, beating against a threshing rack, the use of  
a stick or flail for threshing the crop, and using a pedal or treadle thresher. 
   Another traditional method which is included in manual threshing is the ani- 
mal  threshing,  i.e.,  threshing  with  the  use  of  animals. This  method  is  usually  
carried out at a specific location near the field or in the village. Tractors, if avail- 
able,  can  also  be  used  instead  of  animals  for  treading. Winnowing  is  done  to  
clean the grain after animal treading. Besides this, threshing by a pedal thresher  
or treadle thresher, which consists of threshing drum, base, transmission unit,  
and a foot crank, is also carried out. The threshing drum rotates by pedaling, and  
panicles  are  applied  against  the  threshing  drum.  In  this  method,  chaff,  small

straws, and foreign matters are dropped along with the threshed grain, so win- 
nowing is necessary after threshing. 

3.11.1.2       Machine Threshing 

Mechanical  threshing  has  several  benefits  as  compared  to  other  methods  as  it  
removes  rice  grains  from  the  plant,  reduces  labor  requirements,  and  speeds  up  
threshing, thus reducing losses. Small stationary machine called threshers is being  
used for paddy threshing. Peg-toothed threshing drums are fitted in many stationary  
paddy threshers; however, threshers fitted with rasp bars or wire loop are used as  
well. Feed-in-type threshers are mostly used threshers in which the entire crop is fed  
into  the  thresher.  Besides  this,  hold-on  threshers,  in  which  only  panicle  is  fed  
through the machine, are also used. Generally, these have a lower capacity as com- 
pared to feed-in threshers. These threshers are primarily used in the situation where  
rice straw is to be bundled and stored for later use. Large stationary threshers, in  
which additional cleaning devices, such as centrifugal blower, an oscillating screen,  
and wind board are fitted, are also in use in some regions. Threshed grain need not  
to be cleaned for further handling in these threshers. 

3.11.2        Processing of Rice  

3.11.2.1       Drying 

Drying is the process in which excess moisture from the grains is removed. After dry- 
ing, the rice grain is ready for processing. Storage life of the grains is increased with  
proper drying. Besides this, proper drying also ensures the reduction of biological  
respiration, and thus prevention of deterioration in quality as biological respiration  
causes the loss of grains quality and milling recovery. There are mainly three methods  
of drying, viz., mechanical drying, chemical drying, and sun drying. Mechanical dry- 
ing is the process in which natural or heated air is passed through the grain mass to  
evaporate the moisture from it. The use of mechanical dryers is more reliable as dry- 
ing can be done anytime of the year. In chemical drying method, common salt solu- 
tion having specific gravity of 1.1 to 1.2 is sprayed on the ears of the mature paddy  
crop. Sun drying is the traditional and the most economical method of drying the  
paddy grains. Grains are spread on drying surfaces such as plastic sheets, mats, con- 
crete pavement, or even on fields to dry naturally (Expert System for Paddy 2015). 

3.11.3        Parboiling  

Parboiling is a pre-milling process in which a hydrothermal treatment is given to  
rough rice to improve its milling and cooking quality, storability, and nutritive value  
(Expert  System  for  Paddy  2015). There  are  three  steps  involved  in  this  process:

3   Rice Production in India                                                                        87 

soaking,  steaming,  and  drying.  Since  time  immemorial,  parboiling  of  paddy  has  
been  practiced  in  Indian  households.  In  the  Eastern  and  part  of  Southern  India,  
Eastern  Madhya  Pradesh,  and  Uttar  Pradesh,  the  parboiling  process  is  followed  
extensively. In the process of parboiling, the rice grains are hardened sufficiently  
which lead to a high milling and head rice recovery. Cooking qualities of rice are  
also improved with parboiling process. Gelatinization of the starch granules and  
hardening of the endosperm occurs by parboiling which makes rice grains translu- 
cent. Chalky grains and those with chalky back, belly, or core become completely  
translucent on parboiling. 
    Traditionally, either single or double boiling method was used for parboiling. In  
the single boiling method, unhulled rice is soaked in water at room temperature.  
Then open steaming is done for 20–30 min using iron kettles followed by sun dry- 
ing. In the double streaming method, first steaming is done to raise the temperature  
of unhusked rice and then soaked in cold water for 24–36 h. Thereafter, second  
steaming for 20–30 min is done followed by sun drying. 

3.11.4       Milling  

Milling is an important step in postproduction of rice. Milling is done to remove the  
husk and the bran layers and produce an edible, white rice kernel that is sufficiently  
milled and free of impurities. It is the process in which rice grain is transformed into  
a  form  suitable  for  human  consumption.  So  utmost  care  should  be  taken  during  
milling process so that the head rice recovery percentage can be improved. In this  
process, the rice which is obtained after milling is called raw rice. Nature of rice  
milling losses can be qualitative or quantitative. Qualitative losses are manifested  
low  head  rice  recovery  or  high  percentage  of  broken  kernel,  while  low  milling  
recovery reflects the quantitative or physical loss in rice grains. There are basically  
two methods of milling (DRD 2014). 

3.11.4.1      Traditional Method 

This is the traditional method in which rice is milled by hand-pounding method.  
This method was in practice before the advent of mechanical milling. Implements  
used in this method are hand stone (Chakki), mortar and pestle, and dhenki. The rice  
milled by this method contains more nutritive value than the machine milling rice. 

3.11.4.2      Mechanical Method 

This  is  the  method  in  which  milling  is  performed  by  machines.  The  traditional  
hand-pounding method has steadily decreased with the introduction of mechanized  
mills. The main mills, which are in use, are huller mills, sheller-huller mills, and  
sheller-cone polisher mills.

3.12       Conclusions 

Rice is the staple food for more than 50 % of the world population and 85 % of  
Indian population. The demand for rice is expected to grow continuously as popu- 
lation increases. No doubt, rice production had increased in the past three decades  
continuously beginning with the green revolution. But it has stagnated since 1999.  
It is estimated that by 2020 at least 115–120 million tons of milled rice is to be  
produced in India to maintain the present level of self-sufficiency. The challenges  
before  India  are  the  decreasing  area  and  water  availability  for  rice,  scarcity  of  
labor for growing rice, increasing cost of cultivation and decreasing profitability,  
distress sale, problem of ensuring food and nutritional security to the people below  
the poverty line, storage losses, and emerging problems of climate change. This  
calls for the implementation of such strategies which could change the challenges  
and constraints to opportunities in the near future. There is a need to enhance the  
application of modern scientific tools and technologies to further boost the rice  
production. To solve the emerging problems, modernization, intensification, and  
strengthening of basic, applied, and strategic rice research in areas of rice breed- 
ing,  agronomy,  protection,  and  environmental  research  in  the  wake  of  climate  
change  along  with  relevant  social  science  disciplines  are  essential.  There  is  a  
strong need to monitor rice-based production systems in terms of crop varieties,  
nutrient dynamics, water table, quality of irrigation water, method of irrigation  
and  insect  pests,  diseases,  and  weed  problems  to  evolve  site-specific  and  inte- 
grated management techniques. Enriching rice varieties with genetic resources by  
tapping the biodiversity is of immense importance. It can be proved helpful for  
improving yield potential, nutritional quality of grain, tolerance to major biotic  
and abiotic stresses, and input use efficiency. All the strategies need to be planned  
in such a way that enhancement in rice production could be achieved and main- 
tained without deteriorating the quality of environment and without resource base  
depletion.

Rice Production in Europe

4.1      Summary 

Rice  cultivation  in  Europe  is  restricted  to  a  few  southern  European  countries.  In  
2015, the rice-growing acreage of Italy and Spain together comprised around 75 % of  
a total area of around half a million hectares. The milled rice equivalents in the EU  
amounted to 0.4 % of the global rice production. Japonica rice varieties are dominat- 
ing in Europe. Rice is planted in spring and harvested in autumn. All rice fields in  
Europe are irrigated. Most rice seed is drilled. In some Spanish areas, pregerminated  
rice is sown by air. Average yields per hectare range between 4 and 8 tons. In some  
regions 10 tons can easily be achieved. Monocot weeds are prevailing with wild rice,  
Echinochloa, Cyperus and Heteranthera species being the most frequent representa- 
tives.   Hydrellia    griseola,    Chilo    suppressalis,     Eysarcoris     inconspicuus      and  
Lissorhoptrus oryzophilus have to be regarded as the most serious insect problems.  
Magnaporthe grisea, Cochliobolus miyabeanus and Gibberella fujikuroi are the most  
widespread  disease-causing  organisms. A  wide  range  of  chemical  and  biological  
products is registered for rice protection. For some countries, however, costs for the  
registration of new products are too high compared with the low acreage so that lack- 
ing product innovation becomes a major problem. The acreage of Clearfield rice is  
continuously growing primarily due to wild rice as an increasing problem. Water  
shortage is a problem in a few areas in Spain primarily. Irrigated rice provides a habi- 
tat for a great number of organisms such as migratory birds and deserves special  
attention as far as biodiversity is concerned. Greenhouse gas emission and heavy

metal concentration in rice fields have been a problem in some areas in the past. New  
cultivation methods with a reduced water consumption and new rice varieties should,  
however, contribute to the reduction of these problems. 

4.2      Introduction 

Rice has been grown in Europe for many centuries. Several detailed compilations  
on the history of rice cultivation have been published in recent years, for example,  
by Ferrero and Vidotto (2010). Rice was already known as a crop in Greece more  
than 2000 years ago. First reports on the farming of rice in other European countries  
mostly date back to medieval times. A real change towards larger-scale rice produc- 
tion started, however, only at the end of the nineteenth and beginning of the twenti- 
eth century. In the 1980s, the European rice acreage exceeded one million hectares.  
In 2015, less than half a million hectares were devoted to rice culture in the European  
Union. This figure is quite small compared with other arable crops as we will show  
in the next paragraph. It makes clear, however, that rice plays an economic factor  
and that the area of rice has also an impact on ecology and environment. Some  
opponents of modern agriculture ask why rice is grown in Europe at all and if the  
implications of rice cultivation such as methane production should result in political  
actions against rice cultivation. The main objectives of this chapter are therefore to  
show where and how rice is grown in Europe, which environmental impacts and  
problems are associated with rice cultivation and which role rice cultivation plays  
compared with other crops in Europe. 

4.3      Why and Where Is Rice Cultivated in Europe? 

The acreage of rice in Europe was always rather small when compared with other  
crops such as wheat, barley, maize or oilseed rape (Table 4.1). 
    One can notice a considerable fluctuation in rice and other crops’ acreages which  
has to do with political and technological changes in Europe over the last 50 years.  
At this point, it has to be mentioned that the statistical data for Europe may vary  
depending on the definition of Europe. Data for the European Union (EU) and its

member  states  are  different  from  the  geographically  defined  European  continent  
which includes, for example, large parts of Russia. A considerable amount of rice is  
grown in the Black Sea area of Russia. FAOSTAT data in 1963 include 147,000 ha of  
rice in Russia, for example, and 671,000 ha in 1988, whereas 188,981 ha are reported  
in 2013. The following paragraphs concentrate on rice in the EU primarily. 
    When   we   compare   the   Asian   rice   acreages   and   their   drastic   increase  
(110,827,165 ha in 1963, 130,260,774 ha in 1988 and 146,945,430 in 2013 – figures  
based on FAOSTAT), we might regard rice production in Europe as negligible. 
    Europe has a constant demand for rice as depicted by data from the USDA (Table  
4.2). The European Union imported annual amounts of 1.1 to 1.5 million tons of  
rice between 2000 and 2015 compared with 0.15 to 0.3 million exported tons (milled  
equivalents  and  broken  rice).  More  than  three  quarters  of  the  imported  rice  in  
2013/2014  came  from  four  countries:  India,  Cambodia,  Thailand  and  Pakistan  
(Committee for the Common Organization of Agricultural Markets 2015). Most of  
the imported rice was indica rice (about two-thirds). Between 2010 and 2015, some  
Asian countries succeeded in raising their rice export figures considerably such as  
India, Thailand and Vietnam. China’ s rice imports were increased, however, from  
0.278 million tons in the year 2000 to 4.5 million tons in 2015, whereas Chinese  
exports were lowered from around 3 million tons in 2000 to 0.4 million tons in  
2015. Total global exports and imports increased from 22.8 million tons in 2000 to  
42.6 million in 2015. 
    Another way to exemplify the global situation of rice production is the compari- 
son of production, consumption and stocks. The annual global production of rice  
between 2012 and 2015 ranged between 490 and 500 million tons, and the con- 
sumption was between 477 and 500 million tons during the same period of time.  
Annual stocks amounted to 100 to 200 million tons (EU Rice Economic Fact Sheet  
of the European Commission, March  2015b). Less than 10 % of the global rice  
production is traded (42.6 million tons of around 500 million tons), and food secu- 
rity plays a high role. Several countries have banned the export of rice from time to  
time for this reason (e.g. in 2008, DEFRA 2010). The total European production in  
milled equivalents ranges below two million tons which is less than 0.4 % of the  
global figure. 
    In conclusion, European rice production can never contribute to a global over- 
production. In contrast, it helps to safeguard domestic demands.

    Rice is grown in several countries of the EU as Fig. 4.1 and Table 4.3 demonstrate. 
    The major areas of rice cultivation in Italy are located in the Po valley, in France  
in the Rhone delta and in Central Greece near Thessaloniki. In Spain, rice fields can  
be found near Aragon; in the Ebro Delta, near Valencia; in the Guadalquivir Valley;  
and in Portugal in the Tejo and Mondego Valleys (Ferrero 2007). The Plovdiv and  
the Pazardzhik regions in Bulgaria (Boyadjiev  1996); the counties Ialomiţa, Brăila,  
Olt and Dolj in Romania; and the Great Hungarian Plain are typical rice cultivation  
areas of Eastern Europe. A few thousand hectares of rice are grown in Macedonia  
(Pacanoski and Glatkova 2009). 
    Italy and Spain are the two leading rice-producing countries in Europe with more  
than 75 % of the acreage.

    Yields vary considerably in different European countries. The highest yield val- 
ues are achieved in Greece and Spain. This may have to do with the difference in  
yields for japonica- and indica-type rice. Greece and Spain produce relatively high  
amounts of indica-type rice. Average yields for japonica-type rice range between  
6.2 and 6.5 t/ha, whereas indica-type rice yields between 7.1 and 7.8 t/ha. Japonica-  
type  rice  is,  however,  cultivated  on  two-thirds  of  the  European  acreage,  while  
indica-type rice on one-third only. This may appear as contradictory to the preferred  
European consumption of indica-type rice. The price for japonica-type rice is, how- 
ever, higher on the world market than that of indica-type rice (Table 4.4). 
    It must be noticed here that a strict genetic separation of indica varieties and  
japonica varieties is not possible. Introgression of traditional indica and japonica  
types has increased globally, and the distinctiveness of varietal types has decreased  
(Sleper and Poehlman 2006). 
    Also, exotic rice germplasm is constantly introduced to national breeding pro- 
grams (Cai et al. 2013). On the other hand, rice is categorized not only on the basis  
of indica- and japonica-subspecies properties but also on length, shape and cooking  
characteristics. 
    Following the Regulation (EU) No. 1308/2013 (European Parliament 2013), rice  
is classified in the EU on the basis of the length/width ratio of the grain into the  
groups “round”, “medium”, “long A” and “long B” (Table 4.5). 
    Grain  length  cannot  directly  be  used  for  the  distinction  between  japonica-  
and indica-type rice. A few japonica-type rice varieties have to be classified as

long- grain rice such as the Japanese varieties Nongken 58 and Dali (Wang et al.  
2014) or various American varieties with a tropical japonica background (Sleper  
and Poehlman 2006). 
   The rice market is regulated by the EU rice regulatory regime as of February  
2015  (European  Commission  2015a).  It  is  part  of  the  European  Parliament  and  
Council Regulation (EU) No. 1308/2013. This regulation defines rules for buying- in  
and  selling  of  agricultural  products  under  public  intervention.  Six  EU  member  
states (Greece, Hungary, Italy, Portugal, Romania and Spain) out of the eight rice-  
producing  member  states  have  notified  the  Commission  about  their  decision  to  
apply voluntary couple payments to the production of rice as from 2015. Global  
market prices for the four Asian countries Cambodia, India, Thailand and Pakistan  
ranged between 355 and 430 US$ for milled indica rice in March 2015 (Committee  
for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets 2015). The prices for milled  
rice  in  the  EU  were  considerably  higher,  for  example,  Italian  indica-type  rice  
achieved 640€ in March 2015. Variable conversion rates from € to US$ have to be  
kept in mind. It becomes, however, evident that the difference is quite high. Major  
differences exist between milled and paddy rice; also, prices differ between coun- 
tries. The 3-year average price for japonica-type paddy rice between 2011 and 2014  
was at 307 €/t in Italy and at 288 €/t in Spain and the indica-type paddy rice at 275  
€/t in Italy and at 271 €/t in Spain. 

4.4      How Is Rice Grown in Europe? 

An excellent overview on rice cropping in Italy, Spain and France was edited by  
Ferrero  and  Vidotto  (2006).  As  in  most  regions  with  Mediterranean  climate,  
European rice is planted in spring. Other than in most European countries, it is sown  
in Italy sometimes in the end of March or beginning of April and harvested between  
September and October. The planting period can, however, be extended over a wide  
time range – even to the end of May. Figure 4.2 shows how rice is usually managed  
in Italy. Before planting, the seedbed is usually prepared by ploughing the field.  
Fields are laser-levelled annually or every second year (Fig. 4.3). On around 70 %  
of the fields, rice was broadcast-seeded into flooded fields in 2012 with a centrifugal  
spreader that can also be used for the application of fertilizers (shown in Fig. 4.6).  
The seed is usually soaked in water for 24 h to make it sink and germinate in the  
flooded field. On 30 % of the acreage, rice was drilled into dry soil referred to as the  
year 2012 (Fig. 4.4). This technology is especially used in fields when Clearfield  
rice varieties are adopted. These varieties were selected from rice tissue cultures in  
which tolerance to imidazolinones was observed. The Clearfield technology allows  
the control of weedy rice, a widespread problem in European rice. The application  
of agrochemicals is often easier in dry-seeded rice than in flooded fields. Most trac- 
tors  are  equipped  with  special  metal  wheels  to  enter  wet  rice  fields  (Fig.  4.5).  
Tractors with such wheels are usually quite powerful but heavy. They cannot drive  
on streets and have to be transported by a second tractor (Fig. 4.6). A few farmers

    More than one-third of the acreage was planted with Clearfield (CL) rice in 2014  
(data based on ENR (Ente Nazionale Risi)). Out of more than 140 planted varieties  
in 2014, around 10 were grown on 8000 hectares or more each: CL26 (~18,500 ha),  
Sole  CL  (~15,400  ha),  Centauro  (~14,400  ha),  Volano  (~14,100  ha),  Luna  CL  
(12,000 ha), Sirio CL (~11,300 ha), Selenio (~10,700 ha), Gladio (9800 ha), Delfino  
(~8800 ha) and Baldo (~8000 ha).

   Seeding rates range between 100 and 200 kg seed per ha depending on variety  
and crop management. In some areas as in the Grange area, rice has been grown as  
a monoculture for more than 100 years. Outside this area, maize or soybeans are  
sometimes planted as rotational crops. The dams are, however, kept for later rice  
crops. 
   In Spain, rice is sown in May, sometimes even in June. In most cases, pregermi- 
nated seeds are sown by airplanes on paddies filled with water. In rare cases, rice is  
transplanted. The crop is usually harvested in October. New varieties in Spain are  
regularly characterized by regional institutions such as the IRTA in Catalonia or by  
the Instituto Valenciano de Investigaciones Agrarias. Popular varieties are Tebre,  
Sollana, Bomba, Bahia, Balilla x Solana, Montsianell, Gleva, Guadiamar, J. Sendra,  
Bahia, Senia, Sirio, Piñana or Fonsa. New varieties registered in 2013 are Linda,  
Basholi, Mata, Montell, Carlet and Riet. 
   In Andalucía, around 80 % of the rice fields were planted with Puntal in 2015;  
the second most frequent variety was J. Sendra. In Extremadura, 70 % of the area  
was grown with Gladio and Thaibonnet and 30 % with Thaiperla and Hispagran.  
Gleva is the most cultivated variety in Cataluña (Delta del Ebro); the second most  
frequent varieties are J. Sendra and Montsianell. Valencia grows mainly japonica-  
type rice: Gleva, J. Sendra, Montsianell, Bahia and Senia. Clearfield varieties (e.g.  
Sirio) are gaining ground in all areas. 
   Typical Portuguese varieties are Agulha and Carolino. Agulha is a long-grain  
indica-type rice variety. Carolino is a native short grain japonica-type variety that is  
similar  to  the  Italian Arborio. Another  quite  common  variety  in  Portugal  is  the  
Italian japonica-type variety Ariete. 
   Like in Spain, planting dates in the French Camargue are different from those in  
Italy. Due to the risk of low temperatures, rice is usually sown between April 20 and  
mid-May (Delmotte et al. 2011) or even later. A small proportion of rice is drilled;  
in most farms, however, broadcast seeding with a fertilizer equipment (Fig. 4.7) is  
the standard. 
   In France, 34 rice varieties were available in the year 2014 (http://oryza.com/ 
news/rice-news-europe-middle-east/oryza-highlights-34-rice-varieties-grown- 
france). Half of these were developed directly in France 

•  Long B: Adret, Albaron, Gine, Paty, Rousty Seyne, Vigueirat 
•  Long A: Arelate, Caban, Cambon, Riege, Sirbal, Tiber 
•  Round: Cigalon, Gageron 
•  Medium: Manobi 
•  Aromatic: Aychade 

   The remaining varieties have been developed in Italy. 
   Irrigation of rice fields in the Camargue prevents the accumulation of salt on the  
soil surface and allows its cultivation in rotation with rainfed crops; in some areas,  
continuous rice cultivation is practised (Delmotte et al. 2011). 
   Fertilizer in most European countries is either applied pre-seeding or after plant- 
ing. In Italy, the following amounts are typical: 80–120 kg N, 100–150 kg K O, 2

50 kg N at tillering and 50 kg at panicle initiation are common practice. 
   Rice farms in the EU are managed by highly educated farmers. More than 50 %  
of all Italian rice farmers have either a high school or a university degree. Their  
farms are usually larger than 100 hectares. 

4.5     General Agricultural Problems in European Rice Fields 

4.5.1      Weeds 

The  most  frequent  weed  species  in  Europe  are  representatives  of  the  Poaceae,  
Cyperaceae, Alismataceae, Butomaceae and Pontederiaceae families. Echinochloa  
species,  weedy  rice  (Oryza  sativa)  and  Heteranthera  species  cause  considerable  
competition in European rice fields. This is also the case for Cyperus difformis L.,  
Cyperus  serotinus  Rottb.,  Schoenoplectus  mucronatus  (L.)  Palla,  Bolboschoenus  
maritimus (L.) Palla and Alisma plantago-aquatica L. Leptochloa species such as  
Leptochloa fusca subsp. uninervia (J. Presl) N. Snow seem to have gained ground  
within recent years (Osca  2013). Leptochloa chinensis (L.) Nees, a serious Asian  
weed, was spotted in Italy for the first time in the beginning of this century (Benvenuti  
et al. 2004). It has, however, not become a problem yet and seems to be rare still.  
The spectrum of rice weeds in dry-seeded rice appears to be different from that of  
wet-seeded rice. Heteranthera reniformis Ruiz & Pav., Schoenoplectus mucronatus,  
Bolboschoenus maritimus, Butomus umbellatus L. and Alisma plantago- aquatica  
appear  to  be  more  frequent  in  wet-seeded  rice,  whereas  grass  species  such  as  
Digitaria sanguinalis (L.) Scop.and Sorghum halepense (L.) Pers. and dicots such  
as Polygonum persicaria L. and Portulaca oleracea L. seem to be more frequent in  
dry-drilled fields. Weedy rice, a considerable problem, seems to be no longer the  
serious weed that it was in the past. It has, however, to be considered that the toler- 
ance to imidazolinones is starting to outcross into weedy rice (Ziska et al. 2015) as  
discussed below. The dominant weed genus in rice is Echinochloa. The species in  
this genus are usually difficult to distinguish. The red colour of the stem is normally  
associated with E. crus-galli (L.) P. Beauv.; white biotypes are often identified as  
Echinochloa erecta (Pollacci) Pignatti. Intermediate forms are regarded as hybrids.  
Echinochloa phyllopogon (Stapf) Koss. is usually associated with hairs on the stem  
and  hairs  between  leaf  blade  and  sheath.  Unfortunately,  Echinochloa  oryzoides  
(Ard.) Fritsch is sometimes regarded as synonymous with Echinochloa phyllopogon  
(Stapf) Koss. (e.g. by Hirosue et al. 2000). Other authors regard E. phyllopogon as  
identical with E. oryzicola (e.g. Iwakami et al. 2012). E. colona (L.) Link is described  
as an awnless species in contrast to E. crus-galli. It is, however, obvious that awn- 
less  biotypes  also  exist  within  the  species  E.  crus-galli.  Monochoria  vaginalis  
(Burm.f.) C. Presl ex Kunth is a problem weed in many parts of the world. It can be  
a major problem in Southeast Asia, in Australia and in the Americas. It does not

In some countries, regional differences have to be kept in mind 

play, however, a role in Europe. Minor differences in the weed spectrum of European  
countries  can  be  observed  (Table  4.6).  Country-  or  region-specific  weed  spectra  
have been summarized by a number of authors, e.g. by Vidotto (2013) or Sparacino  
et al. ( 1996) for Italy, Galhano et al. (2011) for Spain, Audebert et al. (2013) for  
France, Vasconcelos et al. ( 1999) for Portugal, Pinke et al. (2014) for Hungary or  
Pacanoski and Glatkova (2009) for Macedonia. 
    The spectrum of registered herbicides differs from country to country. Table 4.7  
shows that the choice of products with different mode of actions (MoAs) is highest  
in Italy and Spain (Table 4.8). 
    For crop selectivity reasons, many products have, however a limitation in appli- 
cation ranges. 
    In dry-seeded rice, clomazone- and pendimethalin-based products are primarily  
applied pre-emergence. Due to the rather small acreage in France, not many herbi- 
cide options are available. 
    Resistance of rice weeds to herbicides has been reported in Europe starting  
from the mid-1990s (Sattin et al.  1999). Most prominent today are publications  
on  weeds  resistant  to ALS  or AHAS  inhibitors  (ALS,  acetolactate  synthase;  
AHAS,  acetohydroxy  acid  synthase)  and ACCase  inhibitors  (ACCase,  acetyl  
coenzyme A carboxylase). Panozzo et al. (2013) characterized the basis of resis- 
tance for 14 Echinochloa crus-galli populations. Seven populations were highly  
cross-resistant to ALS inhibitors, two were resistant to a  sulfonylurea but not to

an imidazolinone and five were multiple resistant to ALS and the ACCase inhib- 
itor profoxydim. Other studies showed that the structure of Echinochloa popula- 
tions in Italian rice fields and the related variability of herbicide sensitivity are  
much more complex than previously expected (Vidotto et al. 2007). Busi et al.  
(2006) compared biotypes of  Cyperus difformis and of Schoenoplectus mucro- 
natus from California, Italy and Spain to describe cross-resistance phenomena  
to a number of ALS herbicides. Calha et al. (2007) detected Portuguese bio- 
types of Alisma plantago-aquatica which were resistant to bensulfuron-methyl.  
Busconi et al. (2012) summarize the distribution of AHAS-resistant weedy rice  
in Italy and discuss the consequences of outcrossing of the Clearfield tolerance  
genes  into  weedy  rice. According  to  GIRE,  the  Italian  Herbicide  Resistance  
Working  Group,  30  %  of  all  rice  fields  are  infested  with  herbicide- resistant  
weeds      (http://oryza.com/italian-government-approves-use-chemicals- control- 
herbicide-resistant-weeds). 
    Unfortunately, herbicides with new modes of action have become quite rare,  
and the number of registered products is continuously reduced (Kraehmer et al.  
2014a, b). This fact leads to ever-increasing resistance risks and to challenges for  
farmers.

4.5.2      Insects  

The smaller rice leaf miner Hydrellia griseola Fallen (Diptera) is the globally most  
widely distributed and one of the most economically significant Hydrellia species  
(Hesler 1995). Also, the Asiatic rice borer or striped rice stemborer, Chilo suppres- 
salis  Walker  (Lepidoptera),  and  the  white-spotted  stink  bug,  Eysarcoris  incon- 
spicuus  H.  Sc.  (Hemiptera),  can  cause  considerable  damage.  The  latter  one  
especially in Andalusian rice fields. The invasive rice water weevil, Lissorhoptrus  
oryzophilus  Kuschel  (Coleoptera),  is  impacting  yields  in  several  European  parts  
today. Resistance of insects to insecticides is not regarded as a problem today. 
    Table 4.9 shows insecticides applied in Italy and Spain. 

4.5.3      Diseases  

Major diseases of European rice are fungal diseases such as rice blast caused by  
Magnaporthe  grisea  (T.T.  Hebert)  M.E.  Barr,  brown  spot  disease  caused  by  
Cochliobolus  miyabeanus  (Ito  &.  Kurib.)  Drechsler  and  bakanae  disease  by  
Gibberella  fujikuroi  (Sawada)  Wollenw.  Resistance  to  fungicides  is  –  like  with  
insecticides – not regarded as a problem in European rice yet. Rice is treated once  
or twice with fungicides depending on growth stage and region in Italy. There are  
also  a  number  of  different  compounds  and  tools  used  as  seed  dressings  as  
Pseudomonas chlororaphis which we will not discuss here. 
    Table  4.10  contains  registered  fungicides  and  mixtures  in  Spain  and  Italy.  
Prochloraz and tebuconazole mixtures are registered in Spain. Fungal diseases are  
not regarded as a major problem in France due to the dry Mistral wind that is blow- 
ing over a long time of the year. 

4.6       Environmental Effects Associated with Rice Cultivation 

4.6.1       Water Consumption 

According to the World Bank green data (Voegle and Badiee 2013), 16.9 % of all agri- 
cultural land in Italy are irrigated. Agriculture withdraws 44 % of the total freshwater  
available. In the northern rice-growing areas of the river Po area, there is, however,  
usually enough water available early in the season so that all crops can be normally  
irrigated and no groundwater problems are to be expected. Aerobic rice systems as  
propagated in some Asian countries with a water shortage are not recommended in  
northern Italy. The situation varies, however, from country to country. The amount of

irrigation is also dependent on the amount of local rain or water evaporation. In the  
                                                                     3 
Vercelli region (Italy), between 15,000 and 40,000 m  irrigation water per hectare of

23,000 m  irrigation water per ha were published by Desplanques et al. (2006). These  
are dimensions which are comparable to water amounts used in other parts of the world

published in the Final Report of the Working Group “MED- RICE” prepared for the  
European  Commission in the framework of Council Directive 91/414/EEC (MED- 
Rice (2003). Hydrologic water balances were discussed for the central Ebro valley by

appears to be similar to other irrigated spring cereals grown in the area.

4.6.2        Gas Emission 

Methane and N O emissions from rice fields have become a major concern since 2 
their  detection  in  the  last  century.  Both  gases  so-called  greenhouse  gases  are  
regarded as major components of global warming. The reasons for the emissions  
from rice fields are anaerobic degradation processes in the paddy water as caused by  
microorganisms such as Archaea species (Liu and Whitman 2008). A few measures  
for the mitigation of methane production in agriculture have been suggested by vari- 
ous  scientists  as  summarized  by  Smith  et  al.  (2008).  In  Italy,  several  studies  on  
methane production of rice fields were carried out within the last decades. Dan et al.  
(2001) could demonstrate the stimulating influence of fertilizers on methane emis- 
sion. Lüke et al. (2010) reported on the biogeography of methane-oxidizing bacteria  
(MOBs) in Italian wetland rice. 

4.6.3       Heavy Metals  

Unfortunately, rice is assimilating some heavy metals into its grains. For example,  
arsenic (As) may be found in rice of different parts of the world (Sommella et al.  
2013). The concentrations of As in Italian rice may vary from about 0.1 mg/kg grain  

----------------------- Page 116-----------------------

110                                                                                H. Kraehmer et al. 

to 0.3 mg/kg grains depending on sample site, variety and region; Cr-values range  
from 0.1 mg/kg to 1.0 mg/kg grains; those for Cd are usually lower and are detected  
at rates between 0.01 and 0.1 mg/kg. 
    As values from Spanish rice were compared with those for Chinese and US rice  
samples in another study (Carbonell-Barrachina et al. 2012) and were proved to be  
lower. 

4.6.4      Biodiversity  

Irrigated rice provides a special habitat for a great number of organisms and contrib- 
utes to the existence of species which could hardly survive in a nonirrigated envi- 
ronment of other arable crops. Already, Carretero ( 1986) reported three decades ago  
about  29  emergent  and  20  floating  or  submerged  plant  taxa  in  rice  fields  of  the  
Valencia and Tarragona provinces of Spain. Vasconcelos et al. ( 1999) listed 47 spe- 
cies of vascular plants in 19 families and 7 species of algae in Portuguese rice fields.  
In the Camargue alone 178 plant species are directly associated with the cultivation  
of   rice    (http://plantes-rizieres-camargue.cirad.fr/generalites/la_flore_du_milieu_ 
rizicole/introduction). Some scientists regard the vegetation associated with rice as  
poor (e.g. Pinke et al. 2014). They make, however, clear that it is composed of plants  
of phylogenetically diverse origin. 
    Picazo et al. (2010, 2012) stress the importance of aquatic systems including rice  
fields for water beetles in Iberia and the Mediterranean basin. 
    Sánchez-Guzmán et al. (2007) demonstrated how rice cultivation can mitigate  
the general loss of wetland for migratory water birds. Toral and Figuerola (2010)  
highlighted  the  reduction  of  natural  wetlands  in  the  Mediterranean  region  by  
80–90 % in the twentieth century due to pressure from human population growth  
and the conversion of wetlands into agricultural and urbanized areas. They provided  
an evidence that rice fields play a major role for water birds today in Andalucia. 
    Unfortunately, European rice field habitats have become home for a number of  
invasive species such as the alien crayfish Procambarus clarkii Girard (Barbaresi  
and Gherardi  2000) or various ostracods such as  Candonocypris novaezelandiae,  
Stenocypris  macedonica,  Cypris  subglobosa  and  Hemicypris  barbadensis  (Valls  
et al. 2014). Some scientists are concerned about the resurgence risk of Malaria with  
Anopheles atroparvus as its vector (Sainz-Elipe et al. 2010). 

4.7       Trends, Chances and Opportunities 

4.7.1       Weed Management 

It has already been mentioned that the number of herbicide registrations has declined  
continuously over the last years. It is therefore encouraging to see that still some  
new technologies for rice are introduced by the agrochemical industry. According to  

----------------------- Page 117-----------------------

4   Rice Production in Europe                                                                           111 

an announcement by Delta Farm Press of April 1, 2015, BASF is about to launch a  
new weed management system under the trade name Provisia. The new Provisia rice  
trait will be tolerant to ACCase inhibitors; it is a non-GMO trait that was found  
through selection and backcrossing into commercial rice varieties (http://deltafarm- 
press.com/rice/new-tools-continue-provide-us-rice-farmers-edge). 
    With this technology, farmers will have an additional tool to control some widely  
distributed weeds such as Echinochloa species and weedy rice. This system was  
also presented at the 2014 annual meeting of the Weed Science Society of America  
and the Canadian Weed Science Society in Vancouver (Harden et al. 2014). It can be  
expected that this technology will arrive at European rice fields soon. 

4.7.2       Hybrid Rice  

Non-GMO hybrid rice cultivation in Italy was started in the year 2012 (Tesio et al.  
2014).  The  first  varieties  were  Clearfield  varieties  and  were  planted  on  around  
1800 ha. Recommended seeding rates for conventional direct-seeded varieties usu- 
ally range between 100 and 200 kg/ha. Seeding rates for hybrid rice are much lower  
(26.5 kg per ha). The number of tillers in hybrid rice is usually higher than in con- 
ventional varieties. In Spain, hybrid rice was commercially sold in 2015. Relatively  
high costs for the seed and the long growing period of the first varieties did not lead  
to a high acceptance of the technology so far. This may change, however, with the  
introduction of more and cheaper varieties. 

4.7.3        Gas Emission 

Maris et al. (2015) analysed the influence of continuous and intermittent irrigation  
on the greenhouse gas emission of rice fields and found considerable differences.  
Dry periods as practiced today with dry-seeded rice can reduce the greenhouse gas  
emission considerably. 
    It appears probable therefore that new cultivation methods may contribute to a  
considerable reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. 

4.7.4       Heavy Metals  

Several scientists have observed already in the past that differences in the uptake of  
heavy metals are based on rice genetics (e.g. Ahmed et al. 2011). Snehlata Shrivastav  
reported on July 15, 2015 in the Times of India that scientists at the CSIR-National  
Botanical Research Institute (CSIR-NBRI), Lucknow, have developed a variety of  
rice that minimizes the uptake of arsenic from the soil (http://timesofindia.indiatimes. 
com/City/Nagpur/Scientists-develop-rice-that-wouldnt-take-arsenic-from- soil/ 

----------------------- Page 118-----------------------

112                                                                                 H. Kraehmer et al. 

articleshow/48075568.cms). It has to be expected that further investigations into the  
rice genome will end up with new varieties in Europe also which help to reduce the  
risk of heavy metal accumulation in rice grains in the future. 

4.7.5      Biodiversity  

Some European rice-growing areas are close to natural parks or protected areas such  
as in the Camargue or in the Ebro Delta (Parc Natural del Delta de l’Ebre). Some  
initiatives strive therefore for a reduction of the use of agrochemicals in these areas.  
A very small proportion of farmers have started to produce organic rice a few years  
ago (Delmotte et al. 2011). In the Camargue, average yields range between 6.3 (for  
conventional rice) and 4.3/ha (for organic rice). Unfortunately, yields may be highly  
variable.  The  worst  problem  for  organic  rice  production  is  apparently  weed  
competition. 

4.8       Conclusions 

The area on which rice is grown in Europe is rather small compared with other rice-  
growing areas, especially in Asia. It has even decreased considerably during the last  
25 years. In some areas, the acreage has become so small that new agrochemicals  
are no longer registered. The milled rice equivalents in the EU amount to 0.4 % of  
the global rice production and can therefore not be regarded as a potential source of  
overproduction. There is, however, a constant demand for rice in the EU which can  
be safeguarded by a few European nations. 
    Due to comparable climatic and growing conditions, a number of weed problems  
in Europe are very similar to those in other rice-growing areas as demonstrated, for  
example, by Kraehmer et al. (2015). Wild rice, Echinochloa, Cyperus and Heteranthera  
species, are the most dominant species all over Europe. It can be expected that the  
pressure caused by  Leptochloa species will increase similar to other rice-growing  
areas in the world. The acreage of Clearfield rice is growing due to its advantage of  
controlling wild rice. Resistance to herbicides creates an increasing risk resulting in  
an  urgent  need  of  herbicides  with  new  mode  of  actions.  Similar  to  weed  spectra,  
European rice diseases and insect problems are also not unique and have been threats  
like in other parts of the world. Three major environmental issues result in discussions  
about rice cultivation in Europe: greenhouse gas emissions, water consumption and  
heavy  metal  accumulation.  New  crop  management  approaches  seem,  however,  to  
reduce anticipated problems to a great extent. On the other, it must not be ignored that  
rice fields are important habitats for a number of plant and animal species, and they  
are an important resort for migratory water birds. They considerably contribute to  
biodiversity in an industrialized agricultural landscape.

5.1      Introduction 

Due  to  high  demand,  rice  production  has  increased  continuously  over  several  
decades, from a growth rate of 1.76 % in 1991–2001 to 3.96 % during 2002–2013.  
This rapid growth rate has made rice the fastest emerging cereal crop in sub-Saharan  
Africa (SSA) and the second major source of energy on the continent (Seck et al.  
2012). However, currently rice production is lower than the demand that is driven  
by rapid population growth and the preference by urban dwellers for rice as a con- 
venient and easy-to-cook cereal compared to traditional dishes (Seck et al. 2013).  
Rice is thus one of the most valued food crops on the continent and a very important  
political crop, shortage or price fluctuation of which can result in civil unrest, as  
witnessed during the rice crisis in 2007–2008 (Seck et al. 2013). 
    Although Africa has vast natural resources and the potential to produce enough  
food for its 900 million people, only 60 % of its demand for rice is produced locally,  
the  rest  being  imported.  Analysts  indicate  that  the  current  dependence  on  the

 international market is not sustainable because supply is unreliable and rice prices  
fluctuate (Wopereis et al. 2013). To overcome this chronic food insecurity, African  
policy makers have developed ambitious plans for achieving food self-sufficiency and  
to turn rice into a profitable venture for farmers and other stakeholders. To realize the  
plans, a wide range of research-for-development activities are being undertaken in  
partnership with various institutions within and outside of Africa (Tollens et al. 2013). 
    This chapter provides historical highlights on rice in Africa, its production systems,  
challenges, and current major activities toward self-sufficiency, as well as the role of  
the Africa Rice Center (AfricaRice) as a center of excellence for rice research in Africa. 

5.2      History and Importance of Rice in Africa 

5.2.1      History  

Through thousands of years of rice cultivation experience, African farmers have  
generated diverse rice genetic resources, which are well adapted to diverse agro- 
ecologies and multiple biotic and abiotic stresses on the continent (Sanni et al.  
2013). African rice, Oryza glaberrima Steud, is one of the two cultivated species,  
and was independently domesticated from its wild ancestor O. barthii in the Niger  
River delta about 3000 years ago (Jones et al.  1997). Since then, it has spread to  
two  secondary  centers  of  domestication,  one  along  the  coast  in  The  Gambia,  
Senegal, and Guinea-Bissau and the second in the Guinea forest between Sierra  
Leone  and  the  western  part  of  Côte  d’Ivoire  (Portères  1962,  1976).  Molecular  
investigations through isozyme studies followed by simple sequence repeat (SSR)  
and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) confirmed the uniqueness of African  
rice and its close genetic relationship to  O. barthii (Second  1982; Semon et al.  
2005). In its evolution as a cultivated crop, O. glaberrima has shaped the diet and  
culture of Africa region, and it even helped Africa to overcome famine in 1203  
(GRiSP  2015).  Highly  sophisticated  rice  cultivation  technologies  and  cultural  
practices existed in West Africa, with a variety of production systems used in dif- 
ferent  environments  and  landscapes,  including  the  construction  of  elaborate  
canals and dikes in coastal swamps (Carney 2001). This indigenous rice produc- 
tion knowledge is believed to have been transferred to North America, through the  
slave trade that transported people from West Africa to the Americas. This tech- 
nology transfer seems to have contributed to the economy as well as food culture  
of Carolina. For instance, a rice recipe called Hoppin’ John or red rice that is  
popular in Georgia and South Carolina came from the West African recipe called  
Jollo Rice (Carney 2001). 
    However, after the introduction of Asian rice  O. sativa into Africa through East  
Africa by traders from India in the early 1500s (Harlan and Stemler  1976; Ng et al.  
1991), O. sativa has spread westward (Portères 1962) and the cultivation of O. glaber- 
rima has declined.  O. sativa is now widely cultivated on the continent. Although the  
two cultivated species have some traits in common, they are significantly different

from each other (Linares 2002; Agnoun et al. 2012) (Table 5.1). Through thousands of  
years of production in the region, O. glaberrima is well adapted for cultivation in West  
Africa and possesses important traits such as tolerance of biotic and abiotic stresses; on  
the other hand, O. sativa produces much higher yields and therefore has higher com- 
mercial value. Rice breeders have been exploiting the stress tolerance of O. glaberrima  
to improve O. sativa for different stress tolerance traits while maintaining high yields  
(Futakuchi et al. 2012). 
    The collection, conservation, and utilization of genetic diversity of the indige- 
nous cultivated and wild rice species in Africa is the responsibility of AfricaRice and  
the genetic resources are kept in trust for humanity under the auspices of the Food  
and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). The AfricaRice gene  
bank currently has more than 20,000 accessions of  O. sativa and  O. glaberrima as  
well as wild species (O. longisataminata, O. barthii, and  O. stapfii) (Sanni et al.  
2013). Using these genetic resources, African scientists have generated “New Rice  
for Africa” (NERICA) varieties, which combine the high-yielding traits of O. sativa  
with the stress-adaptive traits of African rice, and ushered in the green revolution in  
Africa (Sie et al. 2012). The genome of O. glaberrima has been sequenced through  
collaborative effort, thus providing new opportunities for quick and efficient exploi- 
tation of the genome to develop climate-resilient varieties (Wang et al. 2011). 
    The ever increasing demand for rice is dynamically shaping the rice production  
system,  intensification,  and  expansion.  Consequently,  rice  is  now  grown  in  40  
African countries on nearly 10 million ha of land (AfricaRice 2011; Diagne et al.  
2013) (Fig. 5.1). The five major rice producing countries are Nigeria (1,895,697 ha),  
Madagascar (1,183,614 ha), Guinea (1,005,822 ha), Côte d’Ivoire (968,271 ha), and  
Tanzania (942,438) (Diagne et al. 2013). Many of the rice growing countries have  
favorable policies and national strategic rice development plans, with a keen focus

5.2.2      Current Trends in Rice Production and Consumption 

Rice production and consumption in SSA have progressed at variable rates. From  
1961 to 2006, annual rice production growth rate was 3.18 % compared to 2.9 % for  
annual increase in demand (AfricaRice 2008). Then the increase in production was  
attained mainly from area expansion. However, from 2007 to 2012, an unprece- 
dented production growth rate of 8.4 % per year occurred. This leap occurred after  
the rice crisis of 2007–2008 that triggered positive interventions by governments to  
boost local production—70 % of the increase was due to higher yields per unit area

and only 29 % to area expansion. The annual yield increase that is equivalent to  
108 kg/ha between 2007 and 2012 is comparable to the one obtained in Asia during  
the green revolution (Seck et al. 2013). However, despite these developments, the  
overall rice demand in Africa has outstripped local production and 40 % of the rice  
consumed is imported. Consumption rate is expected to increase by 130 % in 2035  
compared to 2010 (Seck et al. 2013), which urges African rice producers to increase  
their production capacity drastically to meet the ever increasing demand with local  
produce. 

5.3      Major Rice Production Ecologies in Africa 

In Africa,  rice  is  grown  in  rainfed  upland  and  aquatic  environments.  Based  on  
topography, water management and genetic adaptability, the aquatic environment is  
subdivided into four major ecologies: rainfed lowland, deep water, mangrove, and  
irrigated ecology (Sie et al. 2012). High elevation is considered as a special ecology  
due to its specific requirement for cold-tolerant varieties (AfricaRice 2011). 

5.3.1      Rainfed Upland  

Rainfed upland is the second largest rice production ecology in sub-Saharan Africa  
(SSA) (Diagne et al. 2013) (Table 5.2). In this ecology, rice is grown without soil  
surface flooding. Most farmers in this ecology are resource poor and cannot afford  
agricultural inputs. Consequently, they practice the “slash and burn” system as well  
as permanent rice cultivation without a fallow period. Forest areas are cleared to  
exploit the natural fertility of the forest soil. However, since no measure is taken to  
improve the soil fertility and due to weed pressure, rice yields decline drastically  
after one season and farmers have to constantly clear new forest areas for cultiva- 
tion, a system called the “shifting cultivation” (Balasubramanian et al.  2007). In  
sloppy areas, where rice is grown continuously, it is intercropped with other locally  
adopted  crops  as  a  risk  management  strategy  in  case  the  rice  crop  fails  due  to  
drought or poor soil fertility. 
    Land preparation is carried out manually with a hand-hoe or with the help of  
Oxen, to be followed by broadcasting or direct seeding 80 kg of seed per hectare.  
Weeding is done one or two times per season depending on the availability of family  
labor. The major weed species encountered are Cyperus spp., Imperata cylindrical,  
Chromolaena odorata, Digitaria horizontalis, Euphorbia heterophylla,  Ageratum  
conyzoides, and Striga spp. (Rodenburg et al. 2009). 
    The major biotic stresses are blast, African rice gall midge (AfRGM), stem bor- 
ers, bacterial leaf blight (BLB), and rice yellow mottle virus (RYMV) (Table 5.2).  
Despite  huge  losses  caused  by  insects  and  diseases,  SSA  farmers  rarely  apply  
appropriate management techniques. They mostly depend on the innate potential of  
the variety to resist all biotic constraints, while a few control blast with fungicides

and by burning stubbles and weeds after harvest to control viruses. In general rice is  
harvestedand threshed manually, although a few farmers thresh with semiautomatic  
pedal-operated machines. 
    Farmers in SSA often experience crop failure as a result of poor cultural prac- 
tices (such as low inputs, suboptimal crop management practices, and inadequate  
weed  management)  and  lack  of  climate  resilient  varieties.  Major  constraints  per  
ecology are presented in Table 5.2. 
    Upland varieties (such as Dourado Precoce and Iguape Cateto), were initially intro- 
duced from Brazil but were later replaced by IRAT (Institute for Research in Tropical  
Agriculture, France) varieties (such as IRAT 10, IRAT 144, and IRAT 13) and recently  
by NERICA (New Rice for Africa) varieties. Yields under current crop management  
practices by farmers average 1.2 ton/ha (Dramé et al. 2013) compared to 5 ton/ha with

(557,256 ha) and Guinea (532,329 ha) (Diagne et al.  2013). The major genotypes  
found in this ecology are O. sativa tropical japonica type and O. glaberrima. 

5.3.2      Aquatic Ecology  

In SSA about 130 million ha (Diagne et al.  2013) is considered to be under the  
aquatic ecology, but less than 5% is cultivated with rice (Balasubramanian et al.  
2007).  Lowland  varieties  were  introduced  mainly  from Asia—the  earliest  ones  
were photoperiod sensitive and susceptible to biotic and abiotic stresses. Some of  
these accessions with indica background were adopted by farmers due to their con- 
sumer preference (e.g., Gambiaka in West Africa, Supa in East Africa, Makalaoka  
in Southern Africa, particularly Madagascar). They have long grains, good eating  
and cooking qualities and aroma but give low yields. Although improved versions  
have been developed through conventional or mutation breeding techniques and  
released by National Agricultural Research Systems (NARS) institutions, the gap  
between the potential of the germplasm and actual farmers’ yields is still very large. 

5.3.2.1      Rainfed Lowland 

The rainfed lowland ecology, which comprises gentle slopes and inland valleys, is  
the largest ecology, covering 33 % of the whole rice production area, and relies on  
rainfall and ground water (Diagne et al. 2013). Fields could be bunded or unbunded,  
but there is no water control, with droughts and floods being potential problems  
Hatibu et al. 2000. Rice is broadcasted or transplanted and one rice crop is culti- 
vated per year followed by vegetables where residual moisture is available. The  
great potential for rice production in this ecology is highly compromised by biotic  
and  abiotic  constraints,  including  weeds,  insect  pests  (such  as  stem  borers,  
AfRGM, and rice sucking bugs), and diseases (rice blast, brown spot of rice, and  
RYMV) (Table 5.2). 
    Nigeria has the largest rainfed lowland area (1,039,935 ha) followed by Tanzania  
(677,806 ha) and Madagascar (322,688 ha) (Harlan and Stemler  1976). Since most  
lowland rice farmers apply minimal inputs and suboptimal crop management prac- 
tices, the average yield of 1.9 ton/ha is much lower than the potential of up to 6.0 ton/ 
ha (Dramé et al.  2013). Both  O. sativa indica and  O. glaberrima are grown in this  
ecology, of which deep water and mangrove swamps are subdivisions. 

Deep Water Ecology 

Deep water ecology is found in the low-lying wetlands of Madagascar and the  
poorly drained inland valleys of Chad, Guinea, Mali, Niger, and Nigeria. Deep  
water  rice,  also  called  floating  rice,  is  sown  before  the  floodwaters  rise  and

124                                                                            N. Zenna et al. 

flowers just before maximum water depth is reached. Deep water rice varieties  
that can elongate to a maximum water depth of 1.0 m or more and float are suit- 
able for this ecology. They can elongate at a rate of 2–3 cm/day (Catling  1992)  
and up to 6 m high and produce adventitious roots to extract nutrients directly  
from the water. The deep water ecology is currently shrinking due to the expan- 
sion of dam construction that restricts the flow of water. Due to the stresses in this  
ecology,  which  include  drought,  stem  borers,  and  weeds,  the  average  yield  is  
about 0.9 ton/ha (Lancon 2002). 

Mangrove Ecology 

Large tracts of rice production areas in SSA experience excess flooding, tidal sub- 
mergence, saltwater intrusion, salinity, and acid sulfate soils. Mangrove swamp rice  
is found mostly in Guinea Bissau, The Gambia, and Guinea Conakry (Defoer et al.  
2007). In this ecology, rice can be grown during the rainy season, when freshwater  
floods create a salt-free period of 4–6 months. Yields are below 1 ton/ha due to  
salinity,  crabs,  and  other  stresses  (Lancon  2002). The  major  constraints  for  rice  
cultivation in both mangrove and deep water ecologies are low input management  
followed by insect pests and diseases (Table 5.2). 

5.3.2.2     Irrigated Lowland 

Irrigated rice is grown in bunded fields with assured irrigation for one or more crops  
per year. The irrigated ecology is subdivided into irrigated wet season ecology and  
irrigated dry season ecology, based on the source of water (IRRI 2002). This ecol- 
ogy is relatively new to Africa and only 26% of the aquatic area is irrigated (Diagne  
et  al.  2013).  Rice  is  produced  under  irrigation  in  the  Sahel,  humid  forest,  and  
savanna zones and at high elevations. This ecology requires substantial investment  
but yields good returns on investment. The major water sources are dams, diversion  
from rivers, or wells (Saito et al. 2013). 
   In  SSA,  Madagascar  has  the  largest  irrigated  area  (782,487  ha)  followed  by  
Egypt (518,320 ha) and Mali (335,269 ha) (Diagne et al.  2013). In Madagascar,  
irrigated rice is produced in both wet and dry seasons in well leveled terraces with  
water from small earth dams on streams and small rivers. Irrigation schemes are  
smaller in the humid forest and savanna zones than in the Sahel - rainfall is the  
principal source of water and water control is difficult. Consequently, irrigation is  
used as a supplement to protect the crop during dry spells in the cropping season.  
Yields are generally lower than in the Sahel due to less solar radiation, poor soil  
fertility, pests and diseases (Balasubramanian et al. 2007). 
   Land preparation is predominantly by manual labor although animal‐drawn tools  
or hand tractors are also used wherever possible. Large tractors are used only in  
large public or privately owned fields. Direct seeding is a common practice in the  
Sahelian zone while transplanting is practiced in the other zones. Seed is sown at

5   Rice Production in Africa                                                                       125 

30-40 kg/ha either in nurseries or by direct sowing. Farmers widely use organic  
manure and compost to improve the soil, while few progressive farmers apply diam- 
monium phosphate (DAP) as basal fertilizer, urea as top dressing, and other com- 
pound fertilizers, such as NPK. 
    Weeds are less diverse in the aquatic than in the upland ecology. The most com- 
mon weed species are Sphenoclea zeylanica, Cyperus difformis, Echinochloa spp.,  
Oryza spp (wild and weedy rices), and Rhamphicarpa fistulosa (Rodenburg et al.  
2009). Manual weeding is done two to three times per season, depending on labor  
availability. Mechanical weeders are currently being popularized by AfricaRice and  
its development partners. Chemical herbicides are used by a few farmers, especially  
in large farms. 
    Rice is mostly harvested manually and less than 1% is harvested with machines.  
Similarly, 80% of the threshing is done manually, sometimes with the help of oxen  
and tractors, while 15% is with semi-automatic pedal-operated machines; motor- 
ized threshers such as Votex and ASI-threshers (developed by AfricaRice in Senegal)  
are used in less than 5% of cases (AfricaRice 2012; Rickman et al. 2013). 
    The major genotype cultivated in this ecology is  O. sativa indica type. In the  
Sahel as a result of high solar radiation, good water management, low disease pres- 
sure, and other favorable conditions, average yields in the Sahel are high – up to 9  
t/ha (especially during the dry season) and up to 12 t/ha has been achieved with  
good  agricultural  practices  (Haefele  and  Wopereis  2004).  Nevertheless,  extreme  
yield fluctuations have been observed due to; sub-optimal crop management prac- 
tices; poor maintenance of irrigation facilities; extreme temperatures and other fac- 
tors that are not conducive for rice production. As a result, double cropping occurs  
in only 10% of the area (Wopereis et al. 2013). 

5.3.3      High Elevation  

About 7 % of Africa’s rice production area occurs in the high elevation zone, above  
1200 m above sea level (MASL) (Saito et al. 2013). In the tropical highlands of East  
and Central Africa and Madagascar, rice is produced up to 1900 MASL (Fig. 5.2).  
This zone includes fertile rolling uplands, high plateau, and mountainous terrain in  
the archipelago stretching from Ethiopia southward to Angola and Zimbabwe and  
has some of the best agricultural lands in Africa (HarvestChoice 2014). 
    The high elevation consists of both upland and aquatic ecologies. The primary  
constraints are altitudinal low temperatures and flooding during the cropping season  
(Zenna et al. 2010) (Table 5.2). National and international agricultural research cen- 
ters  give  this  zone  special  attention  because  of  its  potential  for  rice  production,  
intensification and expansion, and its unique requirement for cold-tolerant varieties.  
Several cold- tolerant varieties with japonica genetic background have been intro- 
duced, tested and released through the AfricaRice breeding task force mechanism  
(Zenna 2015). Varieties with temperate japonica genetic background, which thrive  
well in cold-prone areas, are more adapted to this ecology than those with indica

genetic background. Japonicas can be furthermore subdivided into tropical japonica  
and temperate japonica, and both are being cultivated in Africa. 

5.4      Genetic Resource Utilization 

The plethora of biotic and abiotic stresses that constrain rice production in Africa  
and climate change provide a great opportunity for developing varieties that per- 
form  well  under  dynamic  stress  conditions.  The AfricaRice  gene  bank  contains  
more than 20,000 rice accessions, including 2500  O. glaberrima (Sie et al.  2012)  
and offer a unique opportunity for collaborative breeding programs to generate new  
varieties in demand. 
    The earliest breeding programs in Africa focused on the introduction of varieties  
from Asia and many aquatic rice varieties were successfully released under the name  
“Sahel”. However, there were no introductions for the upland ecology. To strengthen  
the  rice  breeding  programs  of  national  agricultural  research  institutions  in  SSA,  
AfricaRice (formerly known as WARDA) established regional breeding initiatives  
through which WAB 56–50, WAB 56–104, and WAB 56–125 were developed for  
the upland ecology before the advent of the New Rice for Africa (NERICA) variet- 
ies. NERICA varieties inherited desirable qualities of  O. glaberrima (e.g. drought  
tolerance,  weed  competitiveness,  and  diseases  tolerance)  and  the  high  yielding  
potential of O. sativa (Jones et al.  1997; Dingkuhn et al. 1999). The most desirable  
quality attributes of NERICA varieties are early maturity, tolerance of specific biotic

and abiotic stresses, and yields that are generally as good as for O. sativa varieties  
(Sie et al. 2012). There are currently 18 upland NERICA (NERICA 1–18) and 60  
lowland  NERICA  (NERICA-L  1–60)  varieties.  NERICA  4  (rainfed  upland)  and  
NERICA-L 19 (rainfed lowland and irrigated ecologies) have been widely adopted  
by many countries in Africa. They were released through the participatory varietal  
selection system (PVS) (Sie et al. 2010) initially in Guinea in the 1990s and later in  
several countries across the continent. Nigeria has adopted NERICA 1 and NERICA  
2 on about 200,000 ha. In Uganda, different NERICA varieties were cultivated on  
35,000  ha  in  2007  alone,  and  this  enabled  the  country  to  halve  its  rice  imports  
between 2002 and 2007. Similar successes have been reported in other countries,  
such  as  Burkina  Faso,  Ethiopia,  Guinea,  Mali,  Sierra  Leone,  Liberia,  and  Togo  
(Tollens  et  al.  2013).  The  impact  of  NERICA  adoption  on  poverty  reduction  in  
Benin and Uganda has been documented (Sie et al. 2012). Consequently, NERICA  
has become a brand name for good rice in Africa and is probably better known than  
AfricaRice, the organization that developed it (Sie et al. 2012). 
   PVS was an essential vehicle for sensitizing rice producers to adopt NERICA vari- 
eties—many rice lines were presented to farmers in village-based demonstration plots.  
Farmers were then asked to select their favorite lines at various stages of plant growth  
and to indicate the reasons for their choices. Over the following two seasons, farmers  
took increasing control of their chosen “varieties”. Special attention was paid to feed- 
back from women (Fig. 5.3), because most of Africa’s rice farmers are women, and  
their preferences often turned out to be quite different from those of men. PVS data  
were also used to facilitate the varietal release process and seed production and the  
quick adoption of varieties. The PVS technique worked well throughout West and  
Central Africa as part of the NERICA project, providing the farmers with their pre- 
ferred varieties and generating valuable feedback for rice breeders (Sie et al. 2012). 
   Although conventional breeding has been successfully used to develop new variet- 
ies, it is essential to complement this with molecular breeding to accelerate the develop- 
ment of varieties with tolerance of abiotic and biotic stresses, especially those that are  
controlled by several genes. In collaboration with AfricaRice and other international  
organizations,  National  Agricultural  Research  Systems  (NARS)  scientists  are  now  
using genomic tools in their breeding programs to introduce traits of interest into local  
popular varieties (Ndjiondjop et al.  2013). For example, AfricaRice and its partners  
have identified several useful genes that are now introduced into a number of popular  
varieties  through  marker-assisted  breeding  technique  (AfricaRice  2012;  Ndjiondjop  
et al.  2013) and these are being used in marker-assisted breeding to improve many  
varieties in West Africa. 
   In response to the reality of climate change, the new breeding direction at AfricaRice  
is set to develop rice varieties that are resilient to the changing environment in Africa  
(AfricaRice 2010; Dramé et al. 2013). Consequently, AfricaRice has set up the Africa- 
wide Rice Breeding Task Force (BTF), a systematic continent-wide breeding approach  
involving a variety of partners. The BTF is expected to accelerate the development,  
exchange, and release of rice varieties (Mohapatra 2011). For example, it was used to  
launch “ARICA” (“Advanced Rice for Africa”) (Kumashiro 2016) (Fig. 5.4), a new

generation of high-perfovrming rice varieties. ARICA varieties are the next generation  
of rice varieties for Africa, following the success of the NERICA varieties developed  
in the 1990s and the first decade of this century. Some of the 18 ARICA varieties nomi- 
nated across ecologies through the BTF mechanism have already been released in  
Burkina Faso, Guinea Conakry, Mali, and Uganda (Kumashiro et al. 2013). 
    On the other hand hybrid rice production is gaining momentum in Africa. Starting  
from 2000, several African countries, such as Côte d’Ivoire, Liberia, Madagascar,  
Mozambique, Nigeria, Tanzania, and Uganda, have evaluated rice hybrids imported  
from China. Only Egypt has succeeded in developing a hybrid- rice breeding pro- 
gram and produces Egyptian hybrids on a commercial scale. Yields of 12–14 ton/ha  
have been reported for these hybrids (El Namaky and Demont 2013). Considering  
the potential of the hybrid technology, AfricaRice initiated a hybrid-rice program,

5   Rice Production in Africa                                                              129 

based at its Sahel Station in Senegal, in 2010, to enhance irrigated rice production  
(AfricaRice 2010). The hybrid program is now an integral part of the BTF program.  
Thus 36 multienvironment trials were conducted for the first generation of hybrid  
lines in Nigeria, Mali, Senegal, The Gambia, and Mauritania through which hybrids  
with about 20 % yield advantage over the inbred lines were identified. Several of the  
hybrids emanating from the program are being tested in different countries. Such  
encouraging results from the breeding program coupled with a sustainable seed pro- 
duction  mechanism  will  boost African  rice  production  capacity  (El  Namaky  and  
Demont 2013). Hybrid rice technology is expected to contribute to food security in  
Africa  through:  (i)  exploitation  of  hybrid  vigor  to  enhance  productivity  and  (ii)  
involvement of the private sector in seed production research and development (El  
Namaky and Demont 2013; Kanfany et al. 2014). 

5.5      Challenges and Opportunities in African Rice  
        Production 

There  are  large  differences  (3.2–5.9  ton/ha)  between  potential  and  actual  yields  
obtained by farmers (“yield gaps”) across all rice growing environments (Table 5.2)  
(Saito  et  al.  2013).  There  is,  therefore,  considerable  scope  for  increasing  yields  
(Becker et al. 2003). These yield gaps can be closed by introducing improved vari- 
eties and good agricultural practices (GAP). GAP is an integrated set of recom- 
mended crop, soil, water, and weed management practices (Nhamo et al.  2014).  
GAP for the lowland ecology may include animal or motorized traction for fine soil  
tillage, proper bund making, and leveling, use of certified seeds of improved variet- 
ies, sowing or transplanting in lines, application of judicious doses of composite  
fertilizers, and optimally timed weed control using appropriate herbicide dosages  
followed by weeding with mechanical weeders Becker et al. 2003; Rodenburg and  
Johnson 2009; Wopereis and Defoer 2007; Mghase et al. 2013; Senthilkumar et al.  
2014. Integrated rice management (IRM) options developed by AfricaRice (Lancon  
2002)  include  mechanization,  soil-fertility  management,  and  weed  management  
and have increased yields by about 2 ton/ha and benefited farmers in Burkina Faso,  
Mauritania,  and  Senegal  (Haefele  et  al.  2000,  2001;  Segada  et  al.  2004,  2005).  
However, for timely and optimal field management operations, small scale machin- 
eries are indispensable. 
   Lack of appropriate tools for land preparation, harvesting, and postharvest opera- 
tions  is  another  major  bottleneck  that  makes  rice  cultivation  laborious  and  time  
consuming in Africa. For example, lack of appropriate machinery can delay rice  
harvesting and reduce grain quality (Rickman et al. 2013). The adoption of locally  
manufactured small-scale machinery is an essential support for rice production in  
Africa. Consequently, through its Mechanization Task Force, AfricaRice is assisting  
its  NARS  partners  to  identify  small-scale  machinery  and  adapting  them  to  local  
conditions. Private manufacturers who are trained at AfricaRice are now producing

and  selling  mechanical  weeders,  threshers,  and  harvesters  in  different  countries  
(AfricaRice 2012). Availability of such tools can help rice producers to improve the  
quality of their product and avoid massive losses during the production process. 
    Crop  production  generates  income  for  70  %  of  farm  households  in  SSA  but  
postharvest losses significantly reduce farmers’ real incomes—up to 35 % of the  
produce is lost during pre- and postharvest processes in the field (CGIAR  2013).  
Postharvest losses in SSA may be quantitative (15 % and 25 %) or qualitative (esti- 
mated by the price difference in imported and locally produced rice) (15–50 %). In  
Nigeria alone, an estimated 25 % of the total local production is lost due to ineffi- 
cient postharvest handling and processing (Oguntade et al. 2014). 
    A reduction in the pre- and postharvest losses is necessary to ensure good quality  
produce and make rice cultivation a profitable business. Grain quality depends not  
only on the variety, but also on the whole crop production environment and postpro- 
duction management (Futakuchi et al.  2013). In general, locally produced rice in  
Africa is of lower quality than imported rice, is unable to compete favorably with  
imported rice, and thus has a limited market share (Manful 2012). Currently, grain  
quality analysis is carried out on all accessions and breeding lines nominated for  
multienvironment trials at AfricaRice. The evaluation includes cooking and tasting  
qualities and aroma. Only entries that satisfy the basic requirements are then distrib- 
uted for evaluation through the BTF mechanism (Futakuchi et al. 2013). The con- 
cern for grain quality could be of major importance to the market; however, quality  
seed availability could have an immense value for producers to deliver the quality  
product. 
    Most African  countries  have  weak  seed  systems  that  lack  the  necessary  staff,  
equipment,  and  funding. This  hinders  the  availability  of  sufficient  quality  seed  of

newly  released  varieties  (AfricaRice  2011).  To  alleviate  this  problem, AfricaRice  
developed the community-based seed systems (CBSS) in the late 1990s, where farm- 
ers are trained in best practices for producing “seed of acceptable quality” on their  
farms for themselves and their neighbors (Fig. 5.5) (Sie et al. 2010). CBSS shortens  
the time required for seed of improved varieties to reach farmers (Bèye et al. 2013; Sie  
et al. 2010). There are also regional initiatives, such as by the Economic Community  
of West African States (ECOWAS) and the Association for Strengthening Agricultural  
Research in Eastern and Central Africa (ASARECA) for making the seeds of improved  
varieties  available  to  farmers  (Norman  and  Kebe  2006;  Waithaka  et  al.  2012;  
Kuhlmann 2015). A sustainable and efficient seed  production and delivery system in  
Africa  can  be  developed  in  partnership  between  the  private  and  public  sectors.  
However, such strategic alliance can only prosper by the presence of dynamic national  
policy for agriculture. 
   AfricaRice has assisted many countries to prepare their national rice development  
strategies (NRDS) under the Coalition for African Rice Development (CARD) ini- 
tiative (JICA 2009). There has been a gradual shift in policy in favor of developing  
whole rice value chain. The “rice sector development hubs” is an innovative institu- 
tional approach to the rice value chain mechanism. Rice hubs are geographical areas  
where research products, services, and local innovations are integrated across the  
rice  value  chain  to  achieve  development  outcomes  and  impact.  Hubs  are  testing  
grounds for new rice technologies and follow a “reverse-research approach”, i.e.,  
starting from the market. In the hubs, research innovations, outputs, and products are  
tested, adapted, and integrated into “baskets of good agricultural practices”. Hubs  
are built around large groups of farmers and involve other value chain actors and  
extension  agencies  that  work  together  to  evaluate  technological  and  institutional  
innovations, facilitate diffusion of knowledge and establish linkages along the rice  
value chain. 

5.6     Conclusions 

Rice cultivation in Africa has a long history and has shaped the diet of millions of  
people. In addition to being a staple food in many rice producing countries, it is also  
a cash crop for nearly 70 % of the population that earns its income from agriculture.  
Consequently, rice is considered as the “white gold” of Africa, which is expected to  
contribute to poverty alleviation and food security on the continent. Based on the  
positive  political  will  and  interventions  that  produced  outstanding  achievements  
since the 2008 rice crisis, it will not be long before Africa produces enough rice to  
meet its requirements and for export. However, to realize this potential and capital- 
ize on the current demand-driven production momentum, there is a need to inject  
adequate technological and financial investments into the rice sector. Such invest- 
ment in innovation platforms would galvanize the whole value chain and the result- 
ing scaling-out of relevant technologies would ensure sustainable rice production  
(Tollens et al. 2013; Wopereis et al. 2013).

6.1      History 

Cultivated rice (Oryza spp.) is thought to have been brought to the USA from Africa  
in 1600 AD (Carney 2001; Dugan 2015). By 1650 AD, commercial rice cultivation  
started in South Carolina and Georgia and then expanded to South America after  
introduction by Portuguese colonists in the eighteenth century. The growth of the  
slave population in South Carolina after the mid-eighteenth century also promoted  
rice production in the region due partly to intergenerational transfer of rice-growing  
skills. Within 20 years of its introduction in the Americas, rice was cultivated for

export (Eltis et al. 2007). Currently, US rice is produced predominantly in the South  
Central   region   (Arkansas,   Mississippi,   Missouri,   Louisiana,   Texas)   and   the  
Sacramento Valley of California (Childs and Livezey 2016). The majority of rice  
produced in the South Central USA is long-grain with minimal medium-grain rice,  
whereas short- and medium-grain rice are predominantly produced in California  
(Setia et al. 1994). About half of the US grown rice is exported, mostly to Mexico,  
Central America, Northeast Asia, and the Middle East (Childs and Livezey 2016;  
USDA-ERS 2015). Mexico has several rice production niches scattered around its  
geography and produced close to a million tons of paddy rice a year, prior to the free  
trade treaty with the USA and Canada. Today, 80 % of its consumption comes from  
the USA and only 20 % remains locally produced. 
    In South America, northwest Brazil became a significant center of rice produc- 
tion  by  the  late  eighteenth  century,  while  most  other  South American  countries  
started rice cultivation more recently in the nineteenth or twentieth century. Apart  
from Brazil, Columbia, Ecuador, Peru, Argentina, Uruguay, Guyana, and Paraguay  
are notable rice producers in South America. Outside Asia, Brazil is the largest rice-  
producing country (Schwanck et al.  2015) with important rice-producing regions  
including Maranhão in the northeast, Mato Grosso in the west, Minas Gerais in the  
east,  and  Rio  Grande  do  Sul  and  Santa  Catarina  in  the  south  (Eltis  et  al.  2007;  
Sharma 2010). 
    Central American countries are believed to have started rice culture independent  
of North America in the 1700s (Eltis et al. 2007) due to direct movement of skilled  
labor from West African regions to the Caribbean islands. However, rice was pri- 
marily grown for subsistence in Central America. Currently, Costa Rica, El Salvador,  
Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Panama are notable rice producers in Central  
America, although the total area under rice production in this region is meager com- 
pared to South and North America. Nicaragua, Panama, and Costa Rica are the three  
major rice-producing countries in Central America. Most countries in the Caribbean  
islands grow rice, Cuba and Dominican Republic being the most important ones. 
    The first rice grown in the Americas belonged to Oryza glaberrima Steud. spp.,  
which was indigenous to West Africa (Bell  2010; Porteres  1955), whereas  Oryza  
sativa spp. (indica and japonica  subspecies) were believed to have been brought  
from Asia (Eltis et al.  2007; Heyward  1993). Both  indica and japonica  types are  
cultivated in Brazil (Goulart et al.  2014) and elsewhere in South America. In the  
USA, however, most commercial varieties belong to tropical japonica, while indica  
germplasm has been utilized for breeding purposes only and has never been used  
directly in commercial production (Moldenhauer et al. 2004; Sudianto et al. 2013). 

6.2      Area 

Rice is cultivated on about 7.2 million ha throughout the Americas across diverse  
soil and environmental conditions (Haefele et al. 2014). Brazil and the USA com- 
prise more than 60 % of the total rice production in the Americas (Table 6.1). US

rice area increased rapidly since 1995 primarily due to its higher economic returns  
compared to other crops. In the last 15 years, the highest US rice area of 1.47 mil- 
lion ha was attained in 2010 (IRRI 2016; USDA NASS 2016). The historical trend  
in US rice area over the past 30 years is provided in Fig. 6.1. US rice is grown in  
four major regions: Arkansas Non-Delta, Mississippi River Delta, Gulf Coast, and  
Sacramento Valley of California (Livezey and Foreman 2004). The Arkansas Non-  
Delta,  the  largest  of  the  four  regions,  consists  of  rice  farming  in  northeastern  
Arkansas and the Grand Prairie in South Central Arkansas. The Mississippi Delta  
region is made up of areas in southeastern Arkansas, Mississippi, and northeastern  
Louisiana lying adjacent to the Mississippi River. The Gulf Coast region includes  
areas of southwest Louisiana and the upper and lower Gulf Coasts of Texas. The  
rice area in the Sacramento Valley of California is closer to the west coast. 
    In 2014, out of the total US rice area (approx. 1 million ha), the South Central  
USA accounted for about 83 %, with the remaining from California (USDA NASS

Fig. 6.1   Trends in rice area over the past 30 years in the USA (Source: USDA-ERS 2016) 

2016). The total US rice production was at 8.5 million metric tons in 2014. Rice  
production in the USA remained fairly consistent over the past 10 years with an  
annual variation of <15 %. Arkansas is the top US rice producer (51 % of total rice  
area), followed by Louisiana (15 %), Mississippi (6 %), Missouri (7 %), and Texas  
(5 %) (USDA NASS 2016). Rice productivity in the USA has increased from 7.04  
metric tons per ha in 2010 to 8.48 metric tons in 2014. 
   Brazil produces 2.3 million hectares of the total 5.2 million hectares of rice pro- 
duced  in  the  entire  South  America  (Zorrilla  et  al.  2013;  CONAB.  Companhia  
Nacional de Abastecimento 2015), accounting for 52 % of all irrigated and 38 % of  
rainfed rice in the continent (Ricepedia – Latin, American, and the Caribbean 2015).  
The area under rice in Brazil, however, has declined by 27 % between 2000 (3.1  
million ha) and 2014 (2.3 million ha) (IRRI 2016; USDA FAS 2016). This decline  
has been concentrated on rainfed rice in the central and northern parts of the coun- 
try, whereas irrigated rice area in the southern states has increased slightly. In 2014,  
Brazil produced 12 million metric tons of rice. About two-thirds of Brazil’s total  
rice production comes from Rio Grande do Sul and Santa Catarina region, all under  
irrigated conditions, achieving the highest yields in the country. The average rice  
productivity in Brazil is 5.4 t ha−1 (IRRI 2016; USDA FAS 2016), whereas average  
rice productivity in the Rio Grande do Sul region is at 7.5 t ha−1 (CONAB. Companhia  

Nacional de Abastecimento 2015). Rice area and production in other major South  
American rice producers (Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Argentina, Uruguay, Guyana,  
and Paraguay) are comparatively less (Table 6.1). 
   The contribution of Central America to world rice production is limited. In 2014,  
this region produced 1.1 million metric tons of rice on 295, 000 ha (IRRI 2016; USDA  
FAS 2016). The major rice producers Nicaragua, Panama, and Costa Rica cultivate rice  
on approximately 102,000, 88,000, and 65,000 ha, respectively (Table 6.1). 

6.3     Economics 

The majority of rice produced in the USA is exported, whereas it remains an  important  
crop for domestic consumption in many Central and South American countries, particu- 
larly in Costa Rica, Mexico, El Salvador, Colombia, Peru, Suriname, and Cayenne (Eltis

6   Rice Production in the Americas                                                     141 

et al. 2007; Sharma 2010). Notable rice exporters in South America include Uruguay  
(with 95 % exported), Argentina, Paraguay, and Guyana. The rice economics of USA  
and Brazil, the two major rice-producing countries of the Americas, is discussed here. 
   US rice imports have increased significantly over the past decade by 54 % from  
480,000 metric tons in 2003–2004 to 740,000 metric tons in 2013–2014 (August to  
July  market  year)  (USDA  NASS  2016),  with  most  of  the  imports  coming  from  
Thailand (430,000 metric tons). For the same period, the USA exported 3.4 million  
metric tons of rice, which was nearly fivefold of its imports. Rice exports by the  
USA accounted for US$2.1 billion in 2015 with a slight decrease from 2011 levels.  
The export and import supplies are highly variable based on the US commodity  
stocks and the price difference between US rice and major Asian competitors. 
   Rice farming is one of the most capital-intensive operations in the USA with the  
highest national average land rental values among all major crops (Baldwin et al.  
2011). Economic returns are highly variable due to fluctuating input costs and vola- 
tility in commodity and farm prices. The average farm price per metric ton of rough  
rice in the USA was $310 in 2014 (Table 6.2), which has gradually increased over  
the past decade (USDA-ERS 2015). The average cost of producing one metric ton  
of rice is approx. $148 after deducting operating costs (Table 6.2). Irrigation costs  
also  add  up  to  total  costs,  especially  in  California  where  irrigation  water  is  
expensive. 
   Brazil, like the USA, is both an exporter and an importer of rice. In 2014, it  
exported 850,000 tons and imported 350,000 tons of milled rice (Table 6.1). Rice  
exports from Brazil was the highest in 2010 (1.3 million tons), which declined by  
34 % in 2014 (IRRI 2016) owing to a reduction in area under rice cultivation and  
cheaper grain prices in neighboring countries. Rice production costs in Brazil (US  
$2172/ha)  are  the  highest  among  many  neighboring  countries  in  Latin America  
(South and Central America) (Ricepedia – Brazil 2015). Nevertheless, rice produc- 
tion is viable particularly in the southern region comprising Rio Grande do Sul and  
Santa  Catarina,  due  to  advanced  mechanization  and  irrigated  rice  production.  
Conversely, the northeast and other regions of Brazil mainly produce rainfed rice  
and are less mechanized (Ricepedia – Brazil 2015). 

6.4     Rice-Based Cropping Systems 

In Arkansas, rice is most commonly grown in rotation with soybean, with 72 % of  
the 2014 rice area falling under this rotation (Hardke 2015). Based on a 2011 survey  
of rice crop consultants, 69 % of the scouted rice area in Arkansas and Mississippi  
was rotated from rice to another crop, mostly soybean (Riar et al. 2013a). The rota- 
tion of rice with other crops is viewed by many growers and crop consultants as a  
critical component in implementing the best management practices for mitigating  
herbicide-resistant weeds in rice (Riar et al. 2013a). However, rice followed by rice  
is not uncommon; about 22 % of the 2014 Arkansas rice area was grown following  
rice the previous year (Hardke  2015). The increase in zero-grade (no slope) rice  
production in the Mississippi Delta region has favored continuous rice cultivation

due to the inability of soybean to withstand prolonged periods of saturated soil con- 
ditions  following  intense  rainfall  events  in  the  zero-grade  fields.  In  Texas,  rice-  
fallow- rice  or  rice-fallow-fallow-rice  is  the  most  predominant  system  (69  %  of  
area),  followed  by  rice-soybean-rice  (14  %)  and  rice-rice-rice  (9  %)  (Liu  et  al.  
2016). In California, about 68 % of the rice area is in continuous rice culture due to  
a lack of viable rotation options in the poorly drained soils.

6   Rice Production in the Americas                                                                  143 

    In  the  major  Central American  rice-producing  countries  (Nicaragua,  Panama,  
and Costa Rica), rice is grown under both irrigated (<40 % of the area) and rainfed  
systems, with limited rotation in both cases. In irrigated land, 2 to 2.5 harvests are  
typically expected per year, whereas rainfed rice is usually grown only once in a  
year, with an occasional second crop in favored areas. A great proportion of rice in  
Costa Rica and Panama are grown on rental land. 
    In Brazil, rainfed rice in the north is typically produced in rotation with soybean.  
In the southern irrigated rice region, most of the rice area remains in fallow during  
winter, with cattle grazing as the main practice after rice harvest. The integration of  
rice/cattle intensifies the use of the land and other resources. Recently, area under  
soybean grown in rotation with rice has been increasing, especially in Rio Grande  
do Sul, which includes approx. 25 % of the rice area (IRGA 2015). In other regions,  
however, producers face difficulties in adapting rice-soybean rotation, due to irregu- 
lar water supply. 

6.5      Production Methods 

Rice production practices vary across the Americas. The diverse conditions lead to  
variation in the adoption and utilization of different crop management practices.  
However, these practices are dynamic and continue to evolve in response to chang- 
ing political, environmental, and economic conditions. 

6.5.1      North America  

More than half of the rice in the USA is planted using conventional tillage methods.  
This usually involves fall tillage when the weather is appropriate, followed by a  
spring tillage to prepare the seedbed. Rice production methods in the South Central  
USA are fairly similar. The majority of rice grown in this region is in dry-seeded,  
delayed-flooded system (flooding at the 5- to 6-leaf stage of rice), with only about  
3 % of rice produced under water-seeded system (Hardke 2015). Puddling is a rare  
practice. Stale seedbed technique is generally utilized as a weed control strategy to  
terminate already emerged weeds prior to rice planting using tillage or nonselective  
herbicides. True no-till rice production is not common. California’s rice production  
is vastly different from that of the southern USA; mechanization is more advanced,  
involving seeding by aircraft as well as precision fertilizer and pesticide applica- 
tions. Organic rice production is practiced on about 5 % of the area (McKenzie et al.  
2015). In the Sacramento Valley, zero-grade water-seeded system is the most popu- 
lar rice system (Hill et al. 2006) which relies on permanent earthen levees. No-till  
rice systems are not successful in California as harvest equipment leaves deep tracks  
in the heavy black soils, resulting in poor rice establishment and high weed infesta- 
tions. Fall tillage is necessary to level the field and incorporate rice straw.

6.5.2       Central America 

Most of the rice in Central America is grown as a rainfed crop with little transplant- 
ing,  with  the  exception  of  Nicaragua  where  irrigated  rice  is  more  prominent.  
Mechanized planting and harvesting require renting machinery (about 82 % of the  
area in Costa Rica). Rainfed rice, which is very common in Costa Rica and Panama,  
represents >60 % of the total rice area in these countries (Pulver et al. 2012). Almost  
100 % of the rice in Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador is produced as a rainfed  
crop. Rainfed rice production represents high-risk agriculture due to unpredictable  
rainfall and other resource limitations. Rice is usually grown in monoculture in the  
rainfed cropping systems. 

6.5.3       The Caribbean 

Dominican Republic is the main rice producer in the Caribbean islands, where most  
rice  production  is  irrigated  and  technologically  advanced.  Rice  is  usually  trans- 
planted,  and  after  main  harvest,  most  farmers  go  for  a  ratoon  crop  (“soca”  in  
Spanish). The other big rice producer is Cuba with excellent conditions for good  
rice production, but it depends heavily on imports due to internal problems with  
agricultural development. Haiti, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, and Puerto Rico are  
minor rice producers in the Caribbean region. 

6.5.4       South America 

In South America, rice is predominantly cultivated in direct-seeded system (as in  
the USA) due to high labor costs. This system is practiced in several agroecosys- 
tems from the rainfed to the irrigated areas (Maclean et al. 2002). Nevertheless,  
transplanting  is  practiced  extensively  in  Peru  and  coastal  Ecuador,  whereas  
water-seeded (pre-germinated) rice system is dominant in Venezuela, Guyana,  
and Chile. Large farmers use intensive systems, with more mechanization, pes- 
ticides, and fertilizers, having a competitive advantage compared to small farm- 
ers. The minimum-till cropping system is predominantly used for rice production  
in  lowland  areas,  because  it  allows  for  land  preparation  throughout  the  year,  
reduces production costs, and increases yields by allowing timely seeding. In  
Rio Grande do Sul state of Brazil, for example, 74 % of the rice is planted under  
minimum-till  system  (IRGA  2015).  In  Santa  Catarina,  all  area  under  rice  is  
water-seeded, where rice is pre-germinated and then broadcasted in waterlogged  
fields,  whereas  in  Rio  Grande  do  Sul  state,  about  93  %  of  rice  is  dry-seeded  
(Raimondi et al. 2014).

6   Rice Production in the Americas                                                                145 

6.6      Varieties and Genetic Improvement 

6.6.1      North America  

During the past 20 years, average rice yields in the USA have increased several  
folds due to the development and adoption of more productive cultivars along with  
improved management practices. In Arkansas alone, rice productivity increased by  
2.6 t ha−1 over the past 20 years (Hardke  2015), and similar increases have been  

observed in other states as well (Geisseler and Horwath 2016). Rice breeding pro- 
grams in the USA are not only focused on yield enhancement but also on develop- 
ing   cultivars   with   disease   resistance,   drought   tolerance,   and   early   maturity  
particularly for water deficit rice-growing regions of California. 
    The  development  of  hybrid  rice  cultivars  has  greatly  contributed  to  yield  
enhancement over the years. Currently, almost half of the rice area in the USA is  
planted  with  hybrid  rice.  The  introduction  of  Clearfield™  rice  hybrids  (non- 
transgenic,  genetically  modified  rice  resistant  to  imidazolinone  herbicides  that  
inhibit the acetolactate synthase “ALS” enzyme) not only improved weed man- 
agement in rice but also had higher yield potential compared with previous con- 
ventional  rice  cultivars.  In  2004,  the  Clearfield™  rice  cultivars  accounted  for  
5–16 % of the total rice acreage in South Central USA, which increased about  
400 % by 2014 with the  introduction of improved and high-yielding Clearfield™  
rice  inbred  (e.g.,  CL261)  and  hybrid  (e.g.,  CLXL729,  CLXL745)  cultivars  
(Hardke 2015; Salasi and Deliberto 2010). However, the area under Clearfield™  
rice has started to decline due to increasing ALS inhibitor-resistant weeds in this  
system (Hardke 2015). 
    California is presently the most productive rice-growing region in the world with  
an  average  yield  of  9.5  t  ha−1  (2014)  (USDA  NASS  2016).  Rice  producers  in  

California particularly prefer short- to medium-duration cultivars. Calrose cultivars  
are popular in California since their release in 1948 (Johnston 1958), and now prog- 
enies of improved Calrose cultivars occupy nearly 80 % of the current rice area.  
Apart from these, small area of specialty varieties is also planted, such as sweet rice  
(also called mochi, glutinous, or waxy), arborio types (Italian short-grain rice with  
high amylopectin starch content), and aromatic long grains including conventional  
and a basmati type. 
    Some of the other notable breeding and varietal development efforts in the USA  
include the introduction of “Sierra” – an aromatic long-grain rice for southern USA  
to compete with basmati rice, which is typically imported from India and Pakistan.  
Sierra is currently being grown under both conventional and organic management  
systems. “Neches” is the first waxy variety developed for southern USA, providing  
a market opportunity that has been traditionally filled by imports from Thailand  
(USDA-ARS 2016). 
    The  Clearfield™  rice  cultivars  have  been  widely  cultivated  throughout  the  
mid- southern USA. However, evolution of ALS inhibitor resistance in prominent

rice  weeds  such  as  Echinochloa  spp.  (Riar  et  al.  2012;  Osuna  et  al.  2002)   
(E. crus-galli, E. colona, and others) and sedges (Cyperus esculentus,  C. iria,   
C. difformis, and Schoenoplectus mucronatus) and pollen-mediated transfer of  
herbicide resistance from Clearfield™ rice to weedy O. sativa (Burgos et al. 2014;  
Shivrain et al. 2007; Gealy et al. 2003) have led to the loss of this technology in  
recent years. There is a need for alternative herbicide-resistant rice technologies  
for effectively managing ALS inhibitor-resistant weeds. In this direction, BASF  
Corporation is in the process of commercializing Provisia™ rice (Webster et al.  
2015)  which  is  also  a  non- transgenic,  herbicide-resistant  rice  technology  that  
endows  resistance  to  the ACCase  group  herbicide  quizalofop.  The  Provisia™  
technology will facilitate the effective control of ALS inhibitor-resistant weedy  
O. sativa and other weeds. Provisia™ rice is expected to be adopted in rotation  
with  Clearfield™  rice,  which  will  control  ACCase  inhibitor-resistant  weeds.  
However, due to cases of multiple resistance to ALS and ACCase inhibitor-resis- 
tant herbicides (Heap 2016; Fischer et al. 2000), sole reliance on these two her- 
bicide-resistant  technologies  would  not  be  sustainable.  It  is  important  to  note  
that several Echinochloa populations in the Mississippi River Delta have evolved  
resistance  to  ACCase  inhibitor  herbicides  (Norsworthy  et  al.  2013;  Ruiz- 
Santaella et al. 2006; Tehranchian et al. 2016). Given this, the longevity of the  
Provisia™  rice  technology  is  dependent  on  the  adoption  of  diversified  weed  
management practices. 

6.6.2       Central America 

Availability of improved varieties increased in recent years in Central America  
through a regional cooperative program lead by FLAR (Latin American Fund for  
Irrigated  Rice),  allowing  the  release  of  a  number  of  high-yielding  varieties.  
Almost no hybrid rice is planted in the region. In most Central American  countries,  
few varieties capture most of the planted area, regardless of the cropping system  
practiced.  In  Panama,  for  instance,  two  varieties  derived  from  FLAR  program  
(IDIAP  145-05  and  IDIAP  152-05)  released  in  2005  (Camargo  2006)  occupy  
about 50 % of the total rice area. Likewise in Costa Rica, the variety “Palmar 18”  
is also from FLAR, which was released in 2006, and is planted in about 45 % of  
the rice area (CONARROZ 2016). Clearfield™ rice was introduced in Costa Rica  
in 2004 and later in Nicaragua and Panama. Readily adopted by farmers initially,  
Clearfield™ rice provided a valuable tool to selectively control weedy  O. sativa  
in  cultivated  rice.  Unfortunately,  poor  management  and  noncompliance  of  the  
stewardship guidelines and other agronomic factors resulted in the rapid spread  
and prevalence of imidazolinone-resistant weedy O. sativa and the failure of the  
technology in several areas across the three major Central American rice produc- 
ers (Valverde 2013).

6   Rice Production in the Americas                                                        147 

6.6.3      South America 

Rice  varieties  adapted  to  different  environmental  conditions  and  fulfilling  the  
 market needs are the goals of rice breeding programs in South America. Due to the  
differences in climate and soils among the rice production regions, the largest rice  
producers have their own breeding programs, allowing for the breeding of varieties  
adapted  to  local  conditions  and  market  niches.  Alternatively,  institutions  work  
cooperatively  to  create  varieties  and  test  their  adaptation  in  different  countries.  
Grain yields have drastically increased in the region with the introduction of semi- 
dwarf  cultivars  brought  from  the  International  Rice  Research  Institute  (IRRI),  
beginning  with  the  introduction  of  the  variety  IR8  (Zorrilla  et  al.  2013).  These  
 semidwarf  varieties  have  enhanced  food  security  and  reduced  rice  grain  costs  
(Maclean et al. 2002). 
   Working collaboratively with the International Center for Tropical Agriculture  
(CIAT), FLAR assisted the development of rice cultivars to partner countries in the  
region. The rice breeding program established from the partnership of FLAR and  
CIAT and other public/private entities aims to address the needs of the tropical and  
subtropical  regions,  with  the  goals  of  developing  rice  with  high  yield  potential,  
resistance  to  blast  and  other  pathogens,  lodging  resistance,  tolerance  to  harvest  
delays, and high cooking quality (Zorrilla et al. 2013) In particular, resistance to rice  
“hoja  blanca”  virus  (RHBV)  in  the  tropics  and  cold  tolerance  in  the  temperate  
regions are of importance for genetic improvement. Cold tolerance is a valuable  
trait particularly in Southern Brazil, Uruguay, and Argentina where low tempera- 
tures often occur during the planting window. 

6.7      Major Production Constraints 

6.7.1      Water 

Irrigation water limitations are a growing challenge to rice production in several  
areas. Estimates indicate that about 1600 liters of water is required to produce 1 kg  
of rice (Pimentel et al.  2004). According to Tran (Tran  1997), about 55 % of the  
world’s rice area is irrigated, with a water use efficiency of 50–80 %. Irrigation costs  
are typically high in rice production given the high amounts of water use and ele- 
vated costs associated with pumping. Irrigation by intermittent flooding can enhance  
water  use  efficiency  in  rice  (de Avila  2014).  Other  irrigation  water  conservation  
practices are discussed under the section on crop management. A major problem  
related to irrigated rice is the dwindling water supply. In the USA, rice is irrigated  
principally from groundwater resources, and in many areas, groundwater is depleted  
faster  than  it  could  be  recharged  (Konikow  2011).  The  rate  of  groundwater  

----------------------- Page 153-----------------------

148                                                                                     V. Singh et al. 

                              3     −1 
depletion reached 8 km  yr.            during 2000–2008 in the “US Gulf Coastal Plain”  
(Konikow 2013). Groundwater depletion adversely impacts the long-term sustain- 
ability of water supplies to help meet the crop’s water needs. It is estimated that  
within a decade, some aquifers will no longer be available. Efficient water saving  
systems, improved cultivars, and crop management tactics are needed to be devel- 
oped to enhance water use efficiency in rice. Availability of quality irrigation water  
is another constraint because water salinity is a problem in all continents (Rengasamy  
2006). Salinity issues are usually caused by seawater intrusion, oscillation of soil  
water table, and irrigation water with high amount of salts. As salinity conditions  
can severely impact plant stand and yield, adequate soil drainage and water quality  
monitoring are best practices to mitigate this problem. The development of salt-  
tolerant cultivars is a great contribution from rice breeding efforts. Research in this  
area needs to be continued. 

6.7.2       Soil 

Soil nutrient deficiency or toxicity can be a problem in rice production. Flooding  
alters various biological and chemical processes in the rice root zone, influencing  
the  availability  of  various  mineral  nutrients.  The  impact  of  flooding  on  nutrient  
availability is likely to be enhanced under low hydraulic conductivity and the pres- 
ence of a hard pan. Iron toxicity is a common physiological disorder occurring in  
flooded soils. The stress caused by high concentrations of iron in the soil solution  
can cause 12–100 % yield loss (Sahrawat  2010). Developing cultivars tolerant to  
iron toxicity and improved fertilizer management are efficient techniques to mini- 
mize this problem. In addition to reduced nutrient availability/nutrient toxicity, cer- 
tain  organic  acids  are  also  formed  under  flooded  conditions  that  can  affect  rice  
growth  and  development.  Furthermore,  rice  paddy  is  one  of  the  most  important  
anthropogenic  sources  of  greenhouse  gases  such  as  methane  (CH )  and  nitrous 4 
oxide (N O). Rice water management and improved cropping systems are important 2 
tools to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions from rice paddy. 

6.7.3      Pests  

Weeds, diseases, and insects are some of the major constraints to rice production  
in the Americas (see Sect. 8.3). Among the diverse group of weeds infesting rice  
fields, Echinochloa spp., weedy  O. sativa, and Cyperus spp. have been problematic  
for decades. A very important emerging issue is the rapid evolution and spread of  
herbicide- resistant weeds in the rice system. Plant diseases and insects, in general,  
are more of a concern in tropical climates as there are fewer insect and disease prob- 
lems in temperate regions than in the tropics. Pest occurrence and pressure in rice  
are affected by climate, crop rotation, and production practices. The most important

6   Rice Production in the Americas                                                                 149 

rice diseases in the Americas include Magnaporthe spp., Sclerotium spp., R. solani,  
and R. oryzae. The most important insects infesting rice fields are Oryzophagus spp.,  
Oebalus spp., and Tibraca limbativentris. The extent of damage caused by diseases  
and  insects  is  highly  variable,  depending  on  rice  management  and  climate.  Rice  
breeding  with  tolerance  to  major  insect  pests  and  diseases  will  help  address  this  
issue, along with the development and implementation of integrated management  
practices. 

6.7.4       Climate 

IRRI recognizes that the global environmental change (GEC) will have a negative  
impact on rice production worldwide (IRRI 2015). Air temperature is expected to  
increase due to GEC, and heat stress will be a serious concern particularly in tropi- 
cal areas. It is estimated that an increase in air temperature by 1 °C can cause 10 %  
reduction in rice grain yield (Peng et al.  2004). Further, GEC is expected to raise  
seawater  levels  (NRC  (National  Research  Council)  2011).  Salinity-related  prob- 
lems are expected to increase in rice production areas along coastal regions. 
    While high temperatures can be a problem for rice production in tropical areas,  
low temperatures will be a concern in temperate regions. Low temperatures, when  
occurring during sensitive periods such as seed germination or reproductive stages,  
can  severely  affect  rice  yield.  Further,  solar  radiation  is  an  important  climatic  
 variable that will directly influence rice yield potential. The GEC is expected to  
reduce the quantity and quality of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and  
thereby yield potential. 
    Another important climatic constraint in the Americas is the rainfall variability  
caused by “Southern Oscillation” that promotes the “El Niño” and “La Niña” phe- 
nomena. In El Niño years, the weather is usually dry in North America and Northern  
South America (Northern Brazil), whereas in the southern parts of South America  
(Southern  Brazil,  Uruguay,  and  Argentina),  rainfall  frequency  and  intensity  are  
greater than the normal. Conversely, in La Niña years, a reversal in weather pattern  
is expected. High rainfall events can have a severe impact on rice yield, due to the  
direct effect of flooding during crop establishment or harvest, reduction in solar  
radiation,  and  increase  in  pest  pressure.  Sparse  rainfall  and  dry  conditions  can  
severely impact rice yields due to inadequate supply of irrigation water. 

6.7.5      Extension  

Lack of adequate extension infrastructure and fragmented program implementation  
are important constraints to achieve increased rice yields, especially in the Central  
and South American countries. In the USA, Extension Service is well established,  
linking producers’ needs with research conducted at the universities. In Central and

150                                                                                         V. Singh et al. 

South America, extension activities are carried out predominantly by private com- 
panies that reach mainly large farms or by the sale force of agrochemical compa- 
nies. There is a lack of intensive extension to small- and medium-size rice growers.  
This is a major hurdle in achieving coordinated adoption of best management prac- 
tices and stewardship of technologies on a regional or national scale. Private-public  
partnerships among research institutes, millers, and farmers have been successful in  
the southern zone (Argentina, Southern Brazil, and Uruguay) for an effective tech- 
nology  assessment  and  adoption  system,  allowing  for  high  yields  and  efficient  
farming. 

6.8       Crop Management 

6.8.1       Fertilizer Management  

The nutrient pool in rice production fields is highly dynamic due to prolonged flood- 
ing and its influence on the activity of soil microbial populations responsible for  
nutrient  transformation.  Among  the  essential  nutrients,  nitrogen,  phosphorous,  
potassium, sulfur, iron, and zinc are generally limiting or unavailable for uptake in  
rice soils (Synder and Slaton  2001). However, nutrient deficiencies and fertilizer  
requirements are field-specific and vary considerably across the region. Nitrogen is  
the most limiting nutrient in rice cultivation because of high crop demand, coupled  
with  high  losses  from  the  soil  via  ammonia  (NH )  volatilization,  nitrification- 3 
denitrification processes, and nitrate leaching (Buresh et al.  2008). For judicious  
and profitable nitrogen management in rice, it is important to select a suitable nitro- 
gen fertilizer and formulation and apply the precise amount at the right time with  
appropriate placement in soil (Norman et al. 2013). 
    Ammonium or ammonium-releasing fertilizers such as ammonium sulfate and  
urea are typically the best sources of nitrogen for flooded rice crop (Norman et al.  
2009). Most rice varieties in the Americas require 130–200 kg N ha−1 to produce  

satisfactory yields with good milling quality (Synder and Slaton 2001). However,  
the response to fertilizer application depends on soil type, variety, growth stage at  
application, cropping system, and straw management (Synder and Slaton 2001).  
Soil testing is the best way to determine the amount of nitrogen fertilizer needed  
to  fill  the  gap  between  crop  demand  and  soil  supply  (Norman  et  al.  2013).  
Nitrogen should be applied early in the season and incorporated into the soil to  
reduce volatilization losses. In drill-seeded rice, nitrogen applications are recom- 
mended 2–3 days prior to flooding to minimize losses from the soil. Alternate  
flooding  and  draining  influence  the  nitrification-denitrification  process  and  
increase nitrogen losses from the soil. The N losses from applied urea were esti- 
mated up to 60 % in tropical soil (Ghosh and Bhat 1998; De Datta 1995). Tropical  
conditions in Latin American countries lead to high nitrogen losses due to high  
temperatures and rainfall. The urea fertilizer coated with sulfur, urease inhibitors,

6   Rice Production in the Americas                                                                     151 

and other biodegradable materials can reduce up to 50 % of the ammonia volatil- 
ization  losses  depending  on  soil  type  (Junejo  et  al.  2009).  Split  application  of  
coated urea improves crop quality and soil fertility compared to single or preplant  
application.  Splitting  of  nitrogen  doses  across  critical  growth  stages  helps  in  
achieving higher crop yields. For instance, Espinosa (Espinosa 2002) has found  
that application of nitrogen in three splits consisting of 20 % at planting time,  
20  %  at  tillering,  and  60  %  at  flower  initiation  provided  the  best  rice  yields.  
However, the standard split method assumes that all soils of a given textural class  
(i.e., clay or silt loam) require the same N rate, but such an approach may some- 
times result in under- or overfertilization with N (Norman et al. 2013). To improve  
N fertilizer rate recommendations for rice producers, the N-STaR (the Nitrogen  
Soil Test for Rice) procedure was developed and recommended in North American  
rice-growing regions. This test can measure the soil’s ability to supply N, and the  
N compounds quantified using N-STaR (amino sugar-N, amino acid-N, and NH -4 
N)  are  not  prone  to  loss  due  to  leaching  or  denitrification.  Thus,  the  N-STaR  
method enables N fertilizer prescription on an individual field basis for different  
rice cultivars (Norman et al. 2013; Roberts et al. 2012). 
    Phosphorous requirement of rice is less and deficiencies are less common. As  
phosphorous availability improves with flooding, deficiencies can be observed with  
alternate wetting and drying, due primarily to temporary fixation of phosphorous in  
soil (Hardke 2013). Preplant broadcast- or band-applied phosphorous remains avail- 
able throughout the season. However, adequate phosphorous must be supplied prior  
to the tillering stage because any deficiency after this period may result in yield loss  
(Norman  et  al.  2013).  Phosphorous  application  rates  usually  vary  from  30  to  
65 kg ha−1, and the best approach is to make applications on the basis of soil test  

results (Synder and Slaton 2001). 
    Potassium is required in substantial quantities to maintain the nutrient balance in  
soil-plant system. Evidence suggests that potassium plays a critical role in abiotic  
and biotic stress tolerance (Amtmann et al. 2008; Cakmak 2005; Kant and Kafkafi  
2002). Potassium deficiency could trigger susceptibility to diseases or infestation of  
certain insect pests (Wang et al. 2013). Most of the potassium is accumulated in rice  
straw; therefore, removal of rice residue from the field warrants application of 60 to  
120 kg K O ha−1 (Williams and Smith 2001). Zinc deficiencies are frequent in rice-  
            2 

growing areas in the Americas, particularly in high pH soils. Adequate drainage is  
recommended to alleviate zinc deficiency, and, in severe cases, foliar application of  
zinc fertilizer may be required (Espinosa 2002). 

6.8.2       Irrigation Management  

Most of the area under rice cultivation in North America is irrigated in contrast to  
Central and South America, wherein only about one-fourth of the total rice area is  
under irrigation (Zorrilla et al.  2013). Rice is generally cultivated under flooded

conditions to meet high water demands of the rice crop and achieve weed suppres- 
sion with standing water. In drill-seeded rice, the general practice is to establish a  
permanent flood (5–10 cm depth) from 30 to 45 days after planting until 2 weeks  
prior to harvest. In wet-seeded rice, the water level is initially kept low to allow for  
seedling emergence and root establishment. The fields are typically drained when  
varieties show problems of straight head (a severe Zn deficiency symptom), prior to  
application  of  certain  herbicides  and/or  when  rice  water  weevil  infestations  are  
substantial. 
    The increasing concerns about water scarcity has fueled interest in alternative  
irrigation management strategies in rice, including dry direct seeding, intermittent  
wetting and drying, and sprinkler irrigation (Crusciol et al. 2013; Nalley et al. 2015;  
Tracy et al. 2015). These approaches offer benefits such as water and labor savings  
and  reduced  costs  of  cultivation.  For  example,  Nalley  et  al.  (Nalley  et  al.  2015)  
reported 21–56 % increase in water use efficiency with alternate wetting and drying.  
Likewise, Westcott and Vines (Westcott and Vines 1986) and McCauley (McCauley  
1990) reported 20–50 % reduction in water use in surface-irrigated rice, compared  
to flooded rice. A major consideration when using these alternative irrigation sys- 
tems   is   proper   monitoring   and   adjustment   of   weed   management   practices  
(Bagavathiannan et al. 2011). Moving away from permanent flooding increases the  
window for weed emergence. A grower needs to have a season-long weed manage- 
ment plan in place with the adoption of non-flooded systems. 

6.8.3      Pest Management  

Weeds, diseases, and insects pose a major threat to rice production throughout the  
Americas,  causing  significant  yield  and  quality  losses  annually.  Weeds  such  as  
Echinochloa spp. and weedy  O. sativa, diseases such as M. oryzae and R. solani,  
and insects such as Oryzophagus spp. and O. pugnax are among the most economi- 
cally important pests infesting rice fields in the Americas. Effective pest manage- 
ment is critical to securing the productivity and sustainability of rice in the Americas. 

6.8.3.1      Weed Management 

Weeds are the most widespread and most costly-to-manage pests in rice production.  
The annual loss estimation in US rice due to mismanagement of weeds is approxi- 
mately $45 million (Gealy and Moldenhauer  2005). In Brazil the losses are esti- 
mated to be about US $200 million annually (Oerke 2006; Florez et al. 1999; Andres  
et al. 2016). 
    The spectrum of weeds and dominant weed problems vary greatly with location  
and rice production systems. In the US rice production, Echinochloa spp., weedy   
O. sativa,  Urochloa platyphylla, Sesbania herbacea, and Cyperus spp. are among

6   Rice Production in the Americas                                                         153 

the most important weed species (Norsworthy et al. 2007; Smith 1989; Webster and  
Levy  2009). Among  these,  Echinochloa  spp.  and  weedy  O.  sativa  are  the  most  
 predominant and troublesome weeds in rice culture in the Americas. Depending  
upon the cultivar used, weedy O. sativa and Echinochloa spp. can reduce rice yields  
by 82 % and 70 %, respectively (Smith  1988). Echinochloa spp. with resistance to  
propanil, quinclorac, clomazone, ALS inhibitor herbicides, and ACCase inhibitor  
herbicides have been documented in US rice (Heap 2016). Weedy O. sativa infesta- 
tion is also prevalent in rice production in the Americas. In 2006, 60 % of the major  
rice-growing areas in the USA had weedy O. sativa infestation (Burgos et al. 2008),  
which declined to 25–30 % by the end of the decade due to the widespread adoption  
of Clearfield™ rice technology. However, this trend has reversed lately due to the  
development  of ALS  inhibitor  resistance  in  weedy  O.  sativa  in  fields  where  the  
stewardship programs were not strictly followed. In Brazil, approximately 95 % of  
the  irrigated  rice  fields  are  infested  with  weedy   O.  sativa  (Gianessi  2014).  
Clearfield™ rice technology is the only tool available currently to manage weedy   
O. sativa within rice production fields. 
   Rice production systems in the USA employ a combination of cultural, mechani- 
cal, and chemical control options. Reliance on a single control method does not  
provide sustainable weed control; thus, integration of diverse weed management  
tools is utilized. The use of certified seed for planting is recommended to prevent the  
introduction of weedy  O. sativa and other troublesome weeds. Planting certified  
seed is followed by rice growers in North America; there is zero to no tolerance to  
noxious weed seeds in certified rice seed. Seed certification laws and farmers’ use  
of certified seed may be more lax in other regions of the Americas. A variety of  
cultural practices employed to manage weeds in rice production include, but are not  
limited  to,  crop  rotation,  preplant  tillage,  stale  seedbed,  high  seeding  rates,  and  
proper water management to suppress weeds. 
   Herbicides remain an essential component of integrated weed management pro- 
grams in different rice production systems. Proper selection of herbicides and time  
of application (weed growth stage) is key to achieving adequate weed control. In US  
rice production, application timings include burn-down prior to planting and/or pre- 
plant  applications,  preemergence  (PRE)  applications  immediately  after  planting,  
delayed     preemergence      (drill-seeded    only)    applications    at   spiking,   early-  
postemergence  applications,  mid-postemergence  applications,  preflood  applica- 
tions, and postflood applications. Among the various herbicide options, glyphosate  
and saflufenacil alone or in tank mix with other PRE herbicides are generally used  
for burn-down preplant applications. Clomazone, quinclorac, pendimethalin, and  
thiobencarb   are   important   PRE/delayed   PRE   herbicides,   whereas   propanil,  
cyhalofop- butyl, fenoxaprop-p-ethyl, halosulfuron, bispyribac-sodium, quinclorac,  
saflufenacil, and carfentrazone are popular postemergence (POST) herbicides (Scott  
et al. 2013; CPRW (California Rice Production Workshop) 2016). 
   PRE application of clomazone is widely used in major rice-growing regions of  
the USA as it provides excellent control of Echinochloa spp., Leptochloa spp., and  
Urochloa platyphylla. Propanil has long been a popular POST herbicide and is still

154                                                                                V. Singh et al. 

useful in fields where weed resistance to this herbicide has not yet evolved. Propanil  
provides excellent control of >50 weed species with proper selectivity at a mini- 
mum cost. Additionally, it is compatible with a great number of herbicides with  
other mode of actions. Quinclorac, pendimethalin, thiobencarb, fenoxaprop-p-ethyl,  
cyhalofop-butyl, and combinations of these are commonly used for grass control.  
For  broadleaf  weeds  (including  Amaranthus  spp.  and  Commelina  spp.),  POST  
application  of  saflufenacil  and  bentazon  are  most  commonly  used.  For  aquatic  
weeds  such  as  Heteranthera  limosa,  H.  reniformis,  Ammannia  robusta ,  and  
Sagittaria montevidensis, chemical control includes application of thiobencarb pre- 
flood,  bensulfuron-methyl  early  postflood,  and  2,4-D  from  panicle  initiation  to  
panicle differentiation. 
    In Brazil, a recent shift in rice production from conventional to reduced- and no-  
till systems along with water-seeded systems have brought many changes to man- 
agement practices (Andres et al. 2016). In lowlands of Southern Brazil, rice fields  
are generally left fallowed for one season for cattle grazing. In winter, cattle grazes  
on  cold-adapted  grasses  and  broadleaves  (e.g.,  Lolium  spp.,  Trifolium  spp.,  and  
Vicia  sativa),  and  in  summer,  they  feed  on  grasses  such  as  weedy  O.  sativa,  
Echinochloa spp., and some perennial grasses. Integration of crop-livestock in low- 
land rice fields is an important aspect of weed management in South and Central  
America (Marchezan et al. 2003). However, in irrigated and well-drained rice fields,  
rotation with glyphosate-resistant soybean is most common, which offers an effec- 
tive option for controlling annual grasses such as weedy O. sativa and Echinochloa  
spp. Despite the increasing popularity of Clearfield™ rice technology in drained  
lowlands,  the  use  of  conventional  rice  herbicides  is  still  common  in  South  and  
Central American countries. 
    In Brazil, weed control begins with the use of residual herbicides in mixture with  
glyphosate as preplant application, especially in areas under reduced- or no-till sys- 
tems with delayed flooding. Clomazone is the most commonly used herbicide for  
residual control of several grasses including Echinochloa spp. (Chaves and Garcia  
2005). This PRE herbicide effectively suppresses propanil-resistant E. colona and  
is also used widely in Central America for this purpose (Riches et al. 1997; Valverde  
et al. 2000). As an early-POST application, propanil mixed with clomazone or pen- 
dimethalin  is  generally  utilized  to  improve  weed  control  (Andres  and  Machado  
2004). In fields infested with Echinochloa spp. resistant to auxin-mimic herbicides,  
alternative products including pendimethalin, thiobencarb, and/or clomazone (PRE)  
provide adequate control. To manage ALS-resistant grass species, these herbicides  
are followed by POST applications of quinclorac or propanil. In Latin American  
countries  such  as  Colombia  and  Costa  Rica,  ACCase  inhibitor  resistance  has  
become an increasing issue. ACCase inhibitor-resistant  Echinochloa spp. has not  
yet been reported in Brazil (Andres et al. 2016; Matzenbacher et al. 2014), although  
there is anecdotal information on its occurrence recently. Thus far, ACCase inhibi- 
tor herbicides (fenoxaprop-p-ethyl, cyhalofop-butyl, etc.) are potential alternatives  
for POST control of Echinochloa spp. resistant to ALS inhibitors or auxin-mimic

herbicides (Matzenbacher et al.  2015a). These herbicide options allow farmers to  
adopt 3-year rotation of herbicides, which is helpful in managing resistant weeds  
(Andres et al. 2016). 

6.8.3.2     Disease Management 

Numerous fungal, bacterial, viral, and nematode diseases occur in all rice-growing  
regions, but only some of them significantly damage rice production (Groth and Lee  
2002). In the US rice, M. oryzae and R. solani are the most economically important  
rice diseases. Cercospora janseana can cause yield and quality losses, especially at  
late plantings and in the ratoon (second) crop (Zhou and YK 2014). Burkholderia  
glumae and  Tilletia barclayana can also cause severe damage to rice in epidemic  
years. The USA does not have any of the devastating viral and nematode diseases  
that  occur  in  other  rice  production  areas  of  the  world.  In  the  Central  and  South  
Americas, M. oryzae and “hoja blanca” virus are among the most important dis- 
eases limiting rice production (Pulver 2002). Xanthomonas oryzae pv.  Oryzae and  
C. oryzae also occur in these regions and can cause economic damages in epidemic  
years. 
   There are several options available for managing rice diseases, but employing a  
single disease management tactic is rarely very effective. Rice producers must man- 
age diseases through an integrated use of sanitation and quarantine, cultivar resis- 
tance, chemical control, biological control, and sound cultural practices to maximize  
efficacy. Effective disease management starts with the use of pathogen-free planting  
seed. Exclusion of a pathogen from a certain geographic area or from the rice host  
is the most effective method to prevent various diseases of rice. Plant quarantine and  
use  of  certified  seed  are  two  effective  measures  to  achieve  these  goals.  Cultivar  
resistance  is  an  effective  means  to  manage  rice  diseases. Although  no  cultivars  
highly resistant to multiple or all diseases are available, farmers should plant a resis- 
tant or partially resistant cultivar as often as possible. Cultivars with high levels of  
resistance to M. oryzae and C. oryzae are available, but not to R. solani or X. oryzae .  
Fungicides are available for seed and foliar treatments, but farmers often depend on  
foliar applications to manage diseases. 
   Proper timing of fungicide applications is key to effective disease control; rou- 
tine field scouting for diseases especially from panicle differentiation stage is criti- 
cal  to  identify  suitable  application  timings.  Although  biocontrol  options  are  
promising, commercial applications are limited. Proper cultural practices can sub- 
stantially reduce damage caused by diseases. Crop rotation reduces primary inocu- 
lum and, thus, the severity of diseases. Farmers should use recommended rates of  
seed and N fertilizer since excessive N and dense stands tend to increase the severity  
of many diseases. Planting early can avoid late-season disease pressure and thus  
reduce  rice  blast  and  other  diseases.  Establishing  and  maintaining  a  continuous  
flood are crucial for rice blast control.

6.8.3.3     Insect Management 

Insect pests cause severe damage to rice from planting to harvest. The rice yield  
losses caused by insect pests in the USA and Brazil are 5 % and 10 %, respectively  
(Fritz et al. 2013). Each of the rice production areas has its unique complex of insect  
pests associated with its production ecosystems. Thirteen species are considered as  
major rice insect pests in the Americas (Pulver  2002). In the USA,  Oryzophagus  
spp. and O. pugnax are the major invertebrate pests of rice. Other common insect  
pests  that  can  cause  significant  damage  in  certain  years  and  locations  include  
Diatraea  saccharalis,  Chillo  plejedellus,  Ostrinia  nubilalis,  Eoreuma  loftini,  
Pseudaletia unipuncta, Spodoptera frugiperda, Chironomus spp., Hydrellia grise- 
ola, and H. wirthi (Hummel et al.  2009; Way 2002; Way and Bowling  1991). In  
Latin America,  especially  in  Brazil,  the  Brazilian  rice  water  weevil  (O.  oryzae),  
which  is  not  the  same  rice  water  weevil  species  found  in  the  USA,  is  the  most  
important insect pest in rice production (Gianessi  2014).  Tagosodes oryzicolus is  
also an important pest of rice in Latin America, and it serves as a vector for “hoja  
blanca” virus, spreading this disease in most of the rice-growing areas of Central  
and South America. 
    The best approach to manage insect pests of rice is to use an integrated pest  
management  (IPM)  program  consisting  of  tolerant  cultivars,  cultural  practices,  
chemical control, and biological control. Field scouting for insect population is  
key to successful insect pest management. Cultivar selection is important since  
some cultivars are more tolerant than others to feeding by rice water weevils, rice  
stinkbugs, and stem borers. A variety of cultural practices can be used for insect  
pest control in rice. Early planting, draining the field to the point of cracking, and  
delaying the application of permanent flood are the three primary cultural control  
strategies  for  the  management  of  rice  water  weevil.  Early  plantings  can  also  
reduce attacks by adult rice stinkbugs, armyworms, and stalk borers. Best produc- 
tion practices such as good seedbed preparation, proper seeding rate, and good  
water  management  can  ensure  strong,  uniform  rice  stands  and  reduce  damage  
caused by insect pests. Weak and thin stands are often susceptible to damage by  
these pests. 
    Insecticides are a vital component of the current IPM programs for most rice  
pests. Applications of insecticides with varying mechanisms of action remain  
the major method used to control insect pests of rice throughout the Americas.  
Rice pests can be controlled through seed and/or foliar insecticide treatments at  
proper timing. However, insecticides should be applied only when a pest popula- 
tion reaches or exceeds the economic threshold for treatment. Biological control  
has not been widely used for management of rice insect pests, but some natu- 
rally occurring parasites such as the wasps can play an important role in main- 
taining the populations of stem borers and other insect pests below damaging  
levels. Thus, conscious choice of insecticides that are safe to natural enemies  
should be promoted.

6.9       Emerging Issues 

6.9.1      Herbicide Resistance  

Herbicide resistance is an emerging issue in almost all of the rice-growing areas in  
the Americas. Despite large variability of environment, rice establishment system,  
crop management, and herbicides used, herbicide-resistant weeds have been occur- 
ring in several weed species. Herbicide resistance in the Echinochloa complex is the  
biggest problem throughout the Americas. A diversity of resistance mechanisms,  
including target-site mutations and enhanced metabolic detoxifications, have been  
documented in various Echinochloa populations across the Americas, sometimes  
with more than one mechanism within the same resistant population (Riar et al.  
2013b;  Matzenbacher  et  al. 2015b). The  diversity  of  resistance  mechanisms  and  
occurrence of multiple resistance makes Echinochloa complex a serious issue, com- 
parable with Amaranthus , Conyza, Lolium, and Alopecurus found in other produc- 
tion systems. 
    Herbicide resistance in Echinochloa spp. occurs to propanil, quinclorac, ALS,  
ACCase, very-long-chain fatty acid (VLCFA), and 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5- phosphate  
(DXP) inhibitors. Crop rotation has not been sufficient to prevent the evolution of  
herbicide-resistant  populations.  Multiple  resistance  is  particularly  an  emerging  
threat. The replacement of one herbicide with another, used continuously without  
management diversity, has resulted in the evolution of multiple herbicide resistance.  
In California rice, E. phyllopogon is the most dominant Echinochloa species. The  
herbicide resistance problem in E. phyllopogon surfaced with widespread resistance  
to the ALS inhibitor bensulfuron-methyl and was rapidly succeeded by resistance to  
ACCase, DXP, and VLCFA inhibitor herbicides (Yasuor et al. 2008) including mul- 
tiple resistance in some populations. Multiple resistance in some of the Californian  
E. phyllopogon populations was endowed by enhanced metabolic degradation of the  
herbicides (Yasuor et al. 2008). 
    In Central America and northwestern parts of South America, herbicide-resistant  
E. colona is frequently found. E. colona resistance to propanil was first identified in  
Costa Rica (Fischer et al. 1993; Valverde et al. 2000) but is broadly distributed now- 
adays. In Bolivia, Colombia, Venezuela, and Guyana, rice is cultivated twice a year,  
mainly using pre- germinated systems (Carmona  2013). The double-crop and wet  
establishment systems used in these areas are a high-risk combination for the occur- 
rence  of  herbicide  resistance  due  to  limited  herbicide  rotation,  short  window  of  
herbicide application, and ideal conditions for rapid weed seed multiplication and  
dispersion. In most of these areas, quinclorac, ACCase, and ALS inhibitors have  
been widely used, and weed resistance to these compounds is common. 
    In Central America, propanil-resistant E. colona became noticeable after 20 or  
more years of its use, especially in areas of continuous rice production subjected to  
multiple  (usually  two  or  even  three)  propanil  applications  per  rice  cycle,  either

158                                                                                 V. Singh et al. 

alone or in mixture with herbicides not active on E. colona (Valverde 2007). Propanil  
resistance in E. colona is endowed by the rapid metabolism (hydrolysis) of the her- 
bicide to 3,4-dichloroaniline by an increased arylacyl amidase activity and its rapid  
conjugation to nontoxic forms (Leah et al.  1994; Leah et al.  1995). Based on this  
resistance  mechanism,  the  rice-selective  organophosphate  herbicides,  piperophos  
and  anilofos,  were  developed  as  propanil  synergists  to  control  propanil-resistant   
E. colona (Valverde 2007; Caseley et al. 1996). This is the only case worldwide thus  
far by which a weed with nontarget site resistance to a herbicide has been commer- 
cially controlled using synergists. The introduction of ACCase inhibitor herbicides  
provided an alternative mechanism of action to combat propanil-resistant weeds.  
However, overreliance on the ACCase herbicides such as fenoxaprop and sethoxydim  
has  resulted  in  E.  colona  populations  evolving  resistance  to  these  herbicides,  in  
Costa Rica and Nicaragua, respectively (Caseley et al.  1997; Riches et al.  1999).  
The  introduction  of  bispyribac-sodium  (ALS  inhibitor)  facilitated  the  control  of  
multiple  (propanil  and ACCase  inhibitors)-resistant  E.  colona,  but  resistance  to  
bispyribac-sodium also evolved and was further aggravated by the use of imidazo- 
linones in Clearfield™ rice (Valverde 2007). 
    Clearfield™  rice  was  introduced  initially  in  Costa  Rica  in  2004  and  later  in  
Nicaragua and Panama. Poor management and compliance to the stewardship pro- 
grams and other agronomic factors (Valverde  2013) resulted in the prevalence of  
imidazolinone-resistant E. colona and the failure of the technology in several areas  
across the three major Central American rice producers. Escapes of E. colona popu- 
lations already resistant to bispyribac and cross resistant to imidazolinones were  
persistently treated with mixtures of quinclorac and propanil at advanced growth  
stages, thus selecting for low resistance levels to quinclorac (Valverde unpublished  
findings). E. colona has been successfully managed prior to planting using a stale  
seedbed approach (Valverde and Itoh 2001). For this purpose, glyphosate has been  
the herbicide of choice (Valverde et al. 2001). Unfortunately, glyphosate-resistant  
E. colona populations are now emerging in Costa Rica (Valverde, unpublished find- 
ings). Therefore, multiple-resistant E. colona populations that withstand herbicides  
belonging  to  five  different  mechanisms  of  action  (the  PS  II  inhibitor  propanil,  
ACCase inhibitors, ALS inhibitors, auxinic herbicides, and EPSPS inhibitor glypho- 
sate) are now a major threat to rice production in Costa Rica as well as in Panama  
and Colombia. 
    In Brazil, Argentina, and Uruguay, E. crus-galli is the most frequently found spe- 
cies of the Echinochloa complex. In Brazil, despite the intensive use of propanil  
since the 1980s, resistance to this compound has not occurred, perhaps due to the 2  
or 3 years of fallow practiced to reduce weedy O. sativa infestations. However, an  
intensive use of quinclorac and ALS inhibitors has resulted in resistance to these  
herbicides (Schaedler et al. 2008). Herbicide-resistant weeds are less of a problem  
in  Uruguay  compared  to  other  South  American  countries  due  to  rotation  with  
pastures. 
    Imidazolinone-resistant weedy O. sativa is another important issue in rice culti- 
vation.  The  development  of  rice  cultivars  resistant  to  imidazolinone  herbicides  
(Croughan 1998) provided an unprecedented tool for weedy O. sativa control within

rice production fields. Improved weedy O. sativa control associated with this tech- 
nology has substantially increased rice grain yields (approx. 2500 kg ha−1), resulting  

in benefits at farm and regional levels comparable to that of the dwarf rice varieties  
introduced in the 1970s (Merotto et al. 2016). This technology has been widely used  
in the South Central USA and Southern Brazil, and its utilization is increasing in  
other rice-growing countries in the Americas (Carmona 2013). Gene flow from rice  
cultivars to weedy O. sativa has resulted in the prevalence of imidazolinone- resistant  
weedy O. sativa, challenging the longevity of the technology (Goulart et al. 2014;  
Sudianto et al. 2013; Valverde et al. 2013). In areas where the Clearfield™ rice tech- 
nology is still effective, it is important to emphasize the value of adopting steward- 
ship  recommendations,  which  include  diversified  tactics  and  crop  rotation  in  
reducing the risk of resistance and improving the longevity of the technology. 
   Resistance  in  sedges  is  an  emerging  issue  particularly  in Arkansas  and  other  
parts of the South Central USA. Some of the important herbicide-resistant sedge  
species include C. difformis (propanil, ALS inhibitors), C. esculentus (ALS), C. iria  
(ALS), and C. odoratus (ALS). Other notable resistant weeds present at local scales  
include  Alisma  plantago-aquatica  (ALS),  Ammannia  auriculata  (ALS),  A.  coc - 
cinea (ALS), Eleusine indica (ACCase), Fimbristylis miliacea (ALS), Ischaemum  
rugosum (ALS),  L. panicoides (ACCase),  L. scabra (propanil),  S. montevidensis  
(ALS, bentazon), and Schoenoplectus mucronatus (ALS, propanil) (Heap 2016). 
   The widespread occurrence of herbicide resistance in rice weeds warrants the  
adoption of integrated weed management (IWM) practices. Some of the important  
IWM measures include, but not limited to, the use of certified planting seeds, crop  
rotation, stale seedbed, routine field scouting, diverse herbicide mixtures/rotations  
applied at appropriate timings, and cleaning of farm machinery. The imidazolinone-  
resistant rice cultivars were considered by many farmers as a silver bullet strategy,  
but a failure to adopt sound stewardship practices has resulted in the loss of the  
technology in several areas. This precedence should be considered regarding the  
utilization of the new ACCase-resistant rice cultivars, which currently are in the  
process of commercialization (Harden et al. 2014). 

6.9.2      Off-Target Movement of Pesticides 

Off-target movement of pesticides from rice fields is a growing concern (Marchesan  
et al. 2007; Resgalla et al. 2007; Silva et al. 2009). Off-target pesticide movement  
affects nontarget organisms (Silva et al. 2009) and groundwater as well as surface  
water quality (Silva et al.  2011). After application, only a portion of the applied  
pesticide reaches the target (Gavrilescu  2005), whereas the rest is present in the  
broader environment, subject to various fates. Pesticides typically undergo degrada- 
tion  processes  (biodegradation,  chemical  degradation,  and  photolysis),  transport  
processes (drift, volatility, leaching, and runoff), and retention processes (absorp- 
tion, adsorption, and desorption). The intensity of each process will determine the  
persistence,  efficacy,  off-target  movement,  and  carryover  potential  of  applied

pesticides. The amount of pesticide lingering in the environment will depend on the  
physiochemical characteristics of the pesticide (Martini et al.  2012), the amount  
applied,  and  crop  production  practices  (Martini  et  al.  2013).  Contamination  of  
drinking water supplies with pesticides applied to rice fields is of particular concern.  
Marchesan (Marchesan et al. 2007) and Resgalla (Resgalla et al. 2007) found rice  
pesticides in rivers in Southern Brazil. To reduce off-target movement of pesticides,  
it has been recommended in Southern Brazil that rice paddy should not be drained  
for at least 30 days after application of pesticides. Intermittent flooding and drying  
can be a tool to reduce pesticide transport to the off-target environment (Martini  
et al. 2013). 
    Herbicide  injury  to  rice  due  to  off-target  movement  (drift  and  carryover)  is  
another emerging concern in several areas. Herbicide injuries and yield penalties are  
magnified  when  they  are  combined  with  low  temperature  stress  (Martini  et  al.  
2014), which is common in early-seeded rice in parts of South Central USA and  
Southern  Brazil.  Depending  on  the  crop  rotation  practiced  and  the  burn-down  
herbicide(s) applied, drift/carryover issues can be variable. Glyphosate drift is often  
common because of its widespread use in the Americas. In countries such as the  
USA and Brazil, glyphosate-resistant crops are grown nearby rice fields, and herbi- 
cides are often applied using airplanes, leading to high drift potential. Spray drift is  
the major reason behind the ban of some important rice herbicides in California.  
Herbicide carryover is an important constraint to rice production in Brazil. In par- 
ticular, the imidazolinone herbicides used in the Clearfield™ rice system have long  
half-life  in  paddy  fields  and  can  damage  non-tolerant  crops  grown  in  rotation  
(Marchesan et al. 2010; Pinto et al. 2009). 

6.10       Harvesting and Postharvest Handling 

Rice harvesting and postharvest handling is important to maintain the quality  
and quantity of the yield and to reduce postharvest losses. Rice harvest window  
is highly variable across different locations, but proper selection of harvesting  
date is crucial (Siebenmorgen et al.  2013). High head rice yields are achieved  
when harvesting occurs at about 28–32 days after heading, when 80 % of the  
grains have changed color, or when harvesting at 19–21 % seed moisture content  
for long-grain cultivars and 21–24 % for medium-grain cultivars (Siebenmorgen  
and Hardke 2013). Combine harvesters are commonly used for harvesting in the  
USA, Brazil, and Uruguay (Mejía  2002). While postharvest losses are reduced  
through mechanical handling, cost of mechanical harvesting is a limitation for  
small producers especially in the developing countries (Lantin 1997). For proper  
storage and better milling characteristics, paddy is cleaned free of foreign matter  
and  dried  to  12–15  %  seed  moisture  content  (Gardisser  and  Saichuk  2014).  
On-farm drying is not recommended if the moisture content is >20 % because

the grain quality deteriorates due to inefficient drying. A temperature of 40–43 °C  
is suggested for drying rice seeds, and this can be achieved with shade drying.  
Higher temperatures can lead to physicochemical disorders in the grain (Zheng  
and Lan 2007). The choice of a drier system normally depends on several fac- 
tors, including drying capacity needed, simplicity of installation and operation,  
portability, heat source, and the initial cost of purchase. A diverse range of dry- 
ing equipment and methods are available for rough rice, and advanced computer- 
based  models  have  been  developed  to  assist  agricultural  research  workers  or  
farmers in their selection of dryers for a given crop and situation (Dissanayake  
1991). 
   The rice milling operation involves removal of the husk (dehusking) and the  
bran (polishing) to prepare the edible portion (endosperm) for consumption. On  
average the hull constitutes 20 % and the bran is 10 % of the original rough rice  
weight  (Siebenmorgen  et  al.  2016).  The  milled  rice  yield  (MRY)  indicates  the  
mass of the milled rice expressed as the percentage of the original dried rough rice  
mass, which typically ranges from 68 to 72 % (Siebenmorgen et al. 2016). Head  
rice yield refers to the yield of kernels retaining three-fourth or more of the origi- 
nal length (after removing broken rice). Head rice yield is also expressed as per- 
cent of the original dried rough rice mass and can vary from 0 (all kernels are  
broken) to 70 % (no kernels are broken). The milling quality is often expressed as  
the ratio of the head rice to milled rice yield (Siebenmorgen et al. 2016). However,  
the extent of loss during the milling operation may vary depending on a variety of  
factors, including variety of paddy, condition of paddy during milling, degree of  
milling required, type of rice mill used, operator’s skills, and level of insect pest  
infestations (Mejía 2002). 

6.11      Summary 

Rice will remain an important crop in the Americas due to its vital role in food secu- 
rity and rural economic prosperity. Irrigation water shortage is a growing limitation  
to rice production in many areas, but development of suitable alternative production  
methods will be important. Continued technological advancements will facilitate  
increased resource use efficiency and improved rice yields. Breeding for improved  
varieties will be critical to address production challenges caused by changing cli- 
matic conditions. Pesticide resistance, particularly weed resistance to herbicides,  
and off-target movement of pesticides need immediate attention for research and  
development. A strict compliance of stewardship protocols and implementing best  
management practices are critical to preserve the sustainability of new technologies  
in rice production and reduce their negative impacts on the broader environment.  
More investments in research and extension are vital to secure sustainable rice pro- 
duction in the Americas.

Rice Production in Australia

7.1      Summary 

The rice production is a profitable agro-based industry in Australia. Although the  
area under rice cultivation and total production in Australia is very little in proportion  
to global rice production, its unique agronomy and crop management are notable.  
Since the inception of rice cultivation in irrigated areas of New South Wales (NSW)  
and Victoria states of Australia in the early twentieth century, this industry has pro- 
gressed by leaps and bounds. Rice sowing methods in Australia include wet seeding  
in  cultivated  water  bays,  direct  dry  seeding  in  previous  crop  stubbles,  and  direct  
seeding on permanent raised beds. The medium-grain temperate varieties perform  
best under Australian conditions, and many of these have been developed locally  
through  breeding,  keeping  in  view  the  local  climatic  and  edaphic  conditions.  
Australian farmers produce the most water-efficient rice in the world. The escape  
from major pests and diseases and good management practices allow them to obtain  
the  highest  yield  per  hectare  as  compared  to  all  other  rice-producing  countries.  
Several weeds infest rice fields in Australia, but effective management through her- 
bicides  is  in  practice. The  overall  crop  husbandry  is  well  mechanized  right  from  
sowing to harvest. An integrated system connects farmers, industry, and the govern- 
ment stakeholders which ensures the excellent crop production followed by excellent

resources, the terminal cold stress during the reproductive stage of rice crop, and the  
environmental  concerns  are  major  constraints  to  the  Australian  rice  industry.  
However, the highest water-use efficiency, rapid adoption of innovative conservation  
technologies, development of new cultivars suitable for the changing climate, and  
integrated research with holistic approach are strong features of this enterprise. 

7.2     Introduction 

The rice production in Australia is quite different from the rest of the world in the  
perspective of production, processing, and marketing. The rice is produced only in  
a few regions of the country due to strict regulations about water and land use for  
rice production. The Riverina region of NSW (latitude 33–36°S) is the main hub of  
rice production in Australia (Thompson 2002). Almost all the rice is grown in this  
valley  with  exception  of  a  small  acreage  in  Queensland  and  Western Australia.  
However, the cultivated area and production from those sites are negligible. The  
Riverina Valley is irrigated by two major rivers, Murrumbidgee and Murray, and the  
rice crop uses up to 70 % of the available irrigation water. The overall share of rice  
production from Australia to global production might be only 1 %, but the sustain- 
able production under harsh climates is a success in its own way (Humphreys et al.  
2006). With the highest yields per unit area and water-use efficiency, Australian rice  
has proved its worth internationally (Khan et al. 2010; RGA 2015). The adoptions  
of technology, immense coordination between growers, policy makers, and market- 
ing authorities, and good management practices have made Australian rice a suc- 
cess.  The  rice  production  system  in  Australia  has  gone  through  a  series  of  
transformations, and many agricultural scientists quote the Australian rice industry  
as a fine example of agricultural innovations and technology adoption. One of the  
leading  agricultural  development  departments  in  Australia,  the  Rural  Industries  
Research and Development Corporation (RIRDC), ranked Australian rice industry  
as the world leader in agricultural innovation, resource conservation, sustainable  
production,  and  environmental  safety  on  the  eve  of  launching  Rice  2012–2017  
Research and Development (R&D) Plan (RIRDC 2015). 
   The dry climate and shrinking water resources are the main limiting factors to the  
growth  of Australian  rice  industry  (Lewin  and  Heenan  1985;  Humphreys  et  al.  
2006). The rice growers have managed to sustain rice production in spite of immense  
pressure from the government and community (Lewis  2012). It has emerged as a  
great enterprise being run by the farmers and government jointly without any added  
subsidies. Australian  rice  has  not  only  gained  popularity  due  to  high  yields  and  
water-use efficiency but is also well known for its high quality (SunRice  2015).  
Semidwarf temperate varieties developed by Australian scientists have performed  
very well under local conditions. The rice growers pay special attention to water  
use, land use, and environmental protection by adopting various efficient production

systems suitable under different cropping rotations (McDonald  1994; Thompson  
2002; Humphreys et al. 2006). The lower incidence of natural pests and diseases  
under Australian conditions is an added benefit (Stevens et al. 2006). The future of  
rice production in Australia is bright, keeping in view the pace of ongoing research  
and development. 
   This chapter focuses on the crop husbandry, management practices, and use of  
innovative technologies for rice production in Australia. The basic principles and  
practices of rice production in Australia have been discussed. The developments  
over time and future endeavors have also been highlighted along with the elabora- 
tion of constraints and opportunities. 

7.3      History 

Rice was one of the earliest crops introduced in Australia after British settlement in  
the continent. Having vast experience of growing rice in America and India, English  
people also tried rice farming in different regions of Australia. However, due to the  
climatic differences, varying soil fertility, and other management constraints, it was  
mostly unsuccessful. Although northern regions of Australia have plenty of water,  
rice production was never successful there mainly due to iron and manganese toxic- 
ity in the soil and pest problems (RGA 2015). Some sources indicate the entry of  
rice seeds to Australia back in the 1850s when Chinese people came here as a part  
of famous “Gold rush.” Rice was cultivated first time in 1906 in Murray River basin  
near Swan Hill by a former Japanese parliamentarian, Isaburo Takasuka, who was  
given  80  ha  for  this  purpose  by  the  state  government  of Victoria  (RGA  2015).  
Although it was an unsuccessful experience due to droughts and floods, he contin- 
ued the effort, and the crop was grown and produced on a commercial scale in 1914.  
In the 1920s, the opportunity of growing rice as irrigated crop in Murray-Darling  
basin was availed, and since then, it has become the core area of rice production in  
Australia (RGA 2015). Almost all the Australian rice production comes from this  
area. The first commercial rice crop was produced in 1924 by a group of eight farm- 
ers in Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area (MIA) (around Leeton and Griffith). The seed  
was imported from California by the NSW government. In 1928, the NSW govern- 
ment established the Rice Marketing Board to regulate the marketing and export of  
Australian rice. A company, Ricegrowers Limited (SunRice), was registered to buy  
and export Australian rice, and it is the sole authorized buyer of rice produced in  
NSW for domestic and international outlets since then. 
   During the World War II, rice was declared as an essential and precious food  
commodity, and the Commonwealth pushed the NSW government to reach the  
target of 100,000 tons during that period (SunRice  2015). The task was nearly  
impossible due to shortage of water in the Burrinjuck dam; however, keeping in  
regard  the  crucial,  the  NSW  government  decided  to  improve  cooperation  with  
farmers and to expand the area under rice cultivation (RGA 2015). In cooperation  
with  the  Ricegrowers’ Association  of Australia  (RGA),  the  NSW  government

formed the Rice Production Committee (RPC), and rice cultivation was started in  
Murray Valley in addition to MIA. After the establishment of RGA, the rice pro- 
duction in Australia flourished a lot. A royal commission not only investigated the  
causes of rice failure in MIA but also focused on the cooperation and marketing.  
The  “SunRice”  worked  efficiently  on  storage,  milling,  processing,  packaging,  
sale,  and  export  of Australian  rice.  The  first  rice  mill  was  opened  in  1951  in  
Leeton. Temperate rice varieties from California performed well in Riverina. In  
the 1950s, the rice production recovered a boost in Australia. The number of rice  
farmers in MIA increased from 368 in 1950 to 591 in 1955. In addition, 310 grow- 
ers  also  started  rice  cultivation  in  Murray  Valley  by  1955.  Such  a  substantial  
increment improved the economy of that area, and rice production became a prof- 
itable industry (SunRice 2015). Nowadays, over 1500 farm businesses are linked  
with rice production in MIA of NSW and Murray Valley of NSW and Victoria  
(RGA 2015). 

7.4      Area and Production 

Rice in Australia has an area of 52,000 ha, a production of 819,000 tons, and an  
average yield of >10 t ha−1. More than 85 % of Australian rice is exported to over 70  

countries  across  the  globe  (RGA  2015).  During  the  last  decade,  Australia  has  
increased rice yield per hectare by 30 % while reducing the water consumption by  
60 %, which is a remarkable achievement by any means in modern-day agriculture.  
Rice production shares 11 % of the total irrigation water available for agriculture.  
Some of the key facts about Australian rice are given in Table  7.1. In the recent  
years, the production has decreased due to drought. The highest yield per unit area,  
excellent quality, 50 % less usage of water for every kilogram of rice produced as  
compared  to  the  rest  of  the  world,  and  environmental  friendly  cultural  practices  
make Australian rice superior and unique.

7   Rice Production in Australia                                                           173 

7.5      Production Methods and Cropping Systems 

All the rice sown in Australia is irrigated, mostly through river water or sometimes  
groundwater. The rice is grown in summer season in Riverina, and sowing starts in  
the month of October. The rice seeds are either dispersed aerially in flooded fields  
(wet-seeded)  or  directly  drilled  in  dry  soil  (dry-seeded)  followed  by  irrigation  
(Thompson 2002). Pre-germinated seeds and dry seeds are sown for wet seeding  
and dry seeding, respectively. For dry seeding, 120 kg seed ha−1 is drilled in 15 cm  

apart rows at the depth of 1–3 cm. First irrigation is applied immediately after seed- 
ing, but water is drained out after 24 h (Lewin and Heenan  1985). Rice fields are  
kept flooded for most part of the growing season. A water depth of 15–25 cm is  
maintained depending upon the crop growth stage. A layer of water protects rice  
plants from high day temperatures during early growth stages and also provides  
insulation against very low night temperatures after the month of January. Under  
certain instances, flooding is started after the three-leaf stage, but this prolongs the  
crop  (Thompson  2002).  The  soil  type  for  rice  production  is  very  important  and  
given special attention in Australia. The heavy soils with high water holding capac- 
ity are usually preferred. Moreover, the whole area allocated to one farmer for rice  
production cannot be cultivated in one season. In this regard, farmers have to get  
approval  from  respective  irrigation  corporation  (the  Murrumbidgee  Irrigation  
Limited, Murray Irrigation Limited, or Coleambally Irrigation Cooperative Limited)  
before having a license from the state government (Thompson 2002; RGA 2015).  
The land suitability is determined before the approval to grow rice mainly on the  
basis of soil water holding capacity, infiltration rate, and runoff. No farmer can grow  
rice beyond a set limit on his farm. The subsoil water percolation should also be less  
than 200 mm (Beecher et al. 2000; Thompson 2002). Sowing is mostly done on a  
flat surface, but the raised bed system has also gained popularity due to high water-  
use efficiency and yield improvement. The land is prepared using laser land levelers,  
and usually the whole farm layout is designed in such a way that large bays are  
formed with strong soil embankments (bunds) to hold water (RGA 2015). 
   In Australia,  the  rice  crop  is  usually  followed  by  a  fallow  season  of  up  to  6  
months as the intensive cropping systems are not common. Hence, rice is grown as  
sole crop in most of the rice farming areas (Humphreys et al. 2006). However, some  
farmers also include winter crops like wheat, barley, and some legumes. As most of  
the rice fields are kept ponded for most part of the growing season, soil moisture  
levels are very high for the succeeding crops (Humphreys et al. 2006). The produc- 
tivity of winter crops grown on rice-based permanent beds was increased by 26 %  
(Thompson and North 1994). The major benefits in this system were sufficient soil  
moisture, easy drainage, facilitated interculture and farm operations, and less losses  
during harvesting (Tisdall and Hodgson 1990; Beecher et al. 2003). Earlier, a single  
rice crop in 5 years in rotation with legume-based pastures was also common. Still  
many farmers practice such rotations because they cannot grow rice on more than a  
specified area (McDonald 1979). The direct drilling of rice in pasture sward is use- 
ful to reduce the cost of production (Lewin and Heenan 1985). The seed is drilled at

the rate of 140 kg ha−1 with a triple disk seeder in a well-grazed dry pasture at 15 cm  

row-row distance. A knockdown herbicide is applied prior to seeding to avoid pas- 
ture  regrowth.  The  permanent  water  stand  is  established  after  three-leaf  stage  
(Lewin and Heenan 1985). This rotation significantly improves rice yield because of  
improved soil fertility, suppression of diseases and pests, and weed control due to  
well-established preceding pasture crop (Lewin  1979). 

7.6      Varieties 

Temperate rice varieties are grown in Australia. More than 80 % of Australian rice  
is  raised  from  semidwarf  medium-grain  japonica  varieties  (Thompson  2002).  
Similar varieties performed well in the Mediterranean regions and California due to  
a similar kind of climate (Thompson 2002). Eleven varieties are being successfully  
grown  in  Australia.  These  have  high  water-use  efficiency  and  yield  potential.  
Australian scientists have developed most of these varieties through breeding by  
using germplasm from California and other temperate rice-growing regions (RGA  
2015). The first semidwarf medium-grain variety, M7, was introduced in 1983 in  
Australia and proved successful (Humphreys et al. 2006). Several semidwarf variet- 
ies were developed and released for commercial use in the following years. Those  
varieties  had  multiple  quality  traits,  but  major  focus  was  given  to  the  water-use  
efficiency. Since 2001, almost 97 % rice cultivation in Australia was based on such  
semidwarf medium-grain varieties (Humphreys et al. 2006). During 4 years field  
trails in the eastern Murray Valley, the semidwarf medium-grain cultivars, Illabong  
and Amaroo, produced 9.3 and 10.1 t ha−1 rice grains, while a tall variety, Calrose,  
produced 7.9 t ha−1 (Humphreys et al. 2006). 

    Several  semidwarf  varieties,  including  Amaroo,  Doongara,  Illabong,  Jarrah,  
Kyeema, Langi, Millin, and Opus, were locally developed and released for Australian  
rice growers during 1987 to 1999. Those varieties covered a large area due to the  
added benefits of efficient water use and higher yield (Humphreys et al. 2006). The  
rice industry of NSW not only regulates the development and dissemination of new  
varieties but also ensures the pure seed availability to all the registered growers.  
However, growth period reduction to improve the water-use efficiency also caused  
yield reduction (Reinke et al.  1994; Williams et al. 1999). Developing cold-tolerant  
(during reproductive stage) varieties in addition to high yield and water-use effi- 
ciency is another major task of breeding program (Farrell et al. 2000). 

7.7      Irrigation Management 

Water shortage is a major concern in Australian rice production. Australia is the dri- 
est continent of the planet, and, thus, the freshwater is considered a precious resource  
(RGA 2015). The rice-producing area of Australia is mainly irrigated by the Murray

7   Rice Production in Australia                                                          175 

and Murrumbidgee rivers. The average evapotranspiration during the whole grow- 
ing season is 1200 mm. Soils having root zone drainage of more than 200 mm ha−1  

are restricted for rice production (Thompson 2002). Water use for rice production in  
Australia is almost 50 % less than that for the rest of the world (RGA 2015). Rice  
growers have improvised the irrigation management in a number of ways to improve  
the water-use efficiency. The alternate flooding and drying system (intermittent irri- 
gation) is one such conservation method in which water is applied to saturate the  
root  zone  every  week,  but  fields  are  not  kept  flooded  continuously  until  panicle  
initiation starts. Rice reproduction being a highly sensitive water limitation, fields  
are  kept  flooded  onward  from  panicle  initiation  (Thompson  2002).  In  this  way,  
23–26 % water saving is achieved in comparison with permanent flooding after the  
three-leaf stage. Heenan and Thompson ( 1984) concluded that the intermittent irri- 
gation system was water saving, without reducing the yield and quality of rice at  
Yanco,  MIA.  The  localized  irrigation  for  the  rice  crop  grown  on  raised  beds  is  
another way to enhance irrigation efficiency. Borrell et al. (1997) reported up to  
32 % water saving in this system in Queensland. Australian rice water productivity  
has significantly improved over the years mainly due to higher yields and reduction  
in water use (Humphreys and Robinson 2002). The improved water-use efficiency  
of Australian rice is mainly attributed to yield improvement through an innovative  
approach, rapid technology adoption, varietal improvement, excellent regulations  
like the Ricecheck approach by the NSW Department of Primary Industries (DPI),  
improved nitrogen management, and judicious irrigation scheduling (Russell and  
Dunn 2001; Macadam et al. 2002; Ciavarella et al. 2003; Humphreys et al. 2006).  
On the other hand, the substantial cuts in water use through setting up a water-use  
limit,  reduction  in  deep  percolation,  intermittent  irrigation  approach,  raised  bed  
technique, and good crop husbandry practices have also improved the overall water-  
use efficiency in rice (Muirhead et al. 1989; Bouman and Tuong 2001; Humphreys  
et al.  2001, 2003; Beecher et al. 2002; Thompson et al. 2003; Khan et al. 2004;  
Humphreys et al. 2006). 

7.8      Nutrient Management 

Nitrogen (N) is the only mineral nutrient applied in the form of fertilizer to rice crop  
in Australia. A rare use of other macro- or micronutrient-based fertilizers also exists.  
N is mostly applied in the form of urea as a basal dose, but the amount of fertilizer  
depends on the rotation being followed (Lewin and Heenan 1985). The use of anhy- 
drous  ammonia  and  ammonium  sulfate  as  N  fertilizer  has  also  been  reported  
(McDonald 1979). On the lands where rice is grown in a rotation with legume pas- 
tures, usually no N fertilizer is applied. N fixed biologically through legume pas- 
tures is sufficient for the rice crop in the following season. Chapman and Myers  
(1987) found that rice grown in rotation with soybean and sesbania crops had no N  
fertilizer requirements and the yield was also significantly higher as compared with  
the rice grown in rotation with fallow fields. Up to 260 kg N ha−1 was added by these  

----------------------- Page 181-----------------------

176                                                              A.A. Bajwa and B.S. Chauhan 

legumes, which was available for the rice crop. However, the soils having low fertil- 
ity  status  needed  around  200  kg  N  ha−1  for  semidwarf  short-grain  rice  varieties  

(Lewin and Heenan 1985). 
   In case of wet-seeded aerially sown rice, the whole N fertilizer is mixed in the soil  
before flooding, whereas the N is applied at the three-leaf stage in dry-seeded rice when  
farmers start holding water in those fields (Boerema 1970). There might be N top dress- 
ing in some cases depending on rice variety, crop rotation, and total N requirement  
(Heenan and Lewin 1982; Bacon and Heenan 1997). In a broader view, the average N  
                                                 −1 
application rate was reported to be 120 kg ha       (Batten et al. 2001). The decision about  
the right dose and timing of N application is very important (Humphreys et al. 2006).  
The overdose at an earlier vegetative stage may lead to lodging and sterility particularly  
under cooler conditions during the reproductive phase (Williams and Angus  1994). In  
some soils, the N supply to plant roots may be hindered due to high ambient tempera- 
tures, which is another key factor to determine the adequacy of N fertilizer (Angus et al.  
1994). Humphreys et al. (2006) suggested that increasing the N-use efficiency will also  
improve the water-use efficiency and may help to further enhance the productivity of  
Australian rice. Farmers still do not have reliable standard protocols to measure the  
actual N requirements for rice in a particular kind of soil. Research in this area may  
further boost the vertically oriented Australian rice industry. 

7.9      Weed Management 

Weeds are a major problem in rice fields, depending upon the sowing method and  
crop  rotation  (Lewin  and  Heenan  1985). A  variety  of  weeds  infest  rice  fields  in  
Australia (Table 7.2). Usually the weed diversity and weed density in wet-seeded  
rice  is  much  lower  than  dry-seeded  rice. The  most  problematic  weed  species  in  
Australian rice are  Echinochloa spp. Earlier, the postemergence herbicides, thio- 
bencarb, molinate, and propanil, were commonly used to control Echinochloa spp.  
with varying degrees of efficacy (Fisher et al. 1966; Penman and Jones 1984). Some  
farmers  also  used  to  apply  postemergence  herbicides  in  water  during  flooding  
(Fisher et al. 1966). In such a case, the efficacy was improved, but consideration of  
water depth and herbicide dose remained critical (Lewin and Heenan  1985). Aerial  
sowing of rice in flooded bays had problems of  Cyperus difformis L. which was  
controlled through application of MCPA (Nott et al.  1974). However, the applica- 
tion of MCPA had a negative effect on rice growth, especially when applied before  
tillering. The application after tillering was ineffective because weed had already  
caused substantial losses to crop growth due to resource competition (Cox  1980).  
The use of thiobencarb to control  C. difformis has also been reported but a risk of  
damage to small rice seedlings was associated with it (Lewin and Heenan  1985).  
The existence of Typha spp., especially in a rice crop grown in shorter rotations, was  
also  reported  (Lewin,  1979).  The  best  management  strategy  for  Typha  spp.  was  
found to be the manual eradication and herbicide (MCPA) application during the  
fallow period (Lewin and Heenan  1985).

    In  a  classic  study,  McIntyre  and  Barrett  ( 1985)  compared  the  weed  flora  of  
flooded rice in NSW and California in order to understand the species composition  
and diversity under similar cultural and management practices. In NSW, 55 weed  
species existed, while 60 were present in California. Only 13 species were found to  
be common at both sites, most of these were well-recognized rice weed species  
globally. However, large proportions (73 %) of weed species were native in NSW  
and shifted from aquatic habitats to wetland rice (McIntyre and Barrett 1985). Due  
to this reason, many native weed species were well adapted to flooded rice and were

hard to manage. The effective weed control through herbicides has benefited the  
rice production in Australia for decades. However, the consistent use of herbicides  
has caused the evolution of herbicide resistance. The resistance against many com- 
monly used herbicides was reported two decades ago (Hill et al.  1994; McDonald  
1994). Taylor  (2010)  compared  the  efficacy  of  four  herbicides  against  weeds  in  
direct-seeded  rice  in  Cobram, Victoria,  in  order  to  find  a  suitable  alternative  for  
benzofenap and molinate. Pentoxazone failed to control all the weeds and also had  
a toxic effect on rice crop when applied at the rate of 100–400 g a.i. ha−1; however,  
etobenzanid  (750  g  a.i.  ha−1)  provided  effective  control  for  most  of  the  weeds,  

including E. crus-galli (Taylor 2010). The injury to rice crop was substantial when  
the rate of etobenzanid was increased to 1000 g a.i. ha−1. Another herbicide, safluf- 
enacil (200–300  g a.i. ha−1), provided complete control of all major weeds with  

adequate crop tolerance (Taylor 2010). Hence, etobenzanid and saflufenacil might  
be the alternate herbicides with different modes of action from that of molinate and  
benzofenap and, thus, could offer a good strategy against herbicide-resistant weeds.  
Further research is needed in this area with emphasis on integrated weed manage- 
ment options. 

7.10      Insect Pests and Diseases 

There are only a few insect pests and diseases associated with rice crop in Australia;  
however, substantial yield losses are caused by them (Lewin and Heenan 1985). The  
bloodworm (Chironomus tepperi) is one of the most important rice insects, as it  
chews the root tips of rice and also shoots sometimes. To avoid the losses, different  
chemical insecticides are used, especially in aerially sown rice crop (Jones  1968).  
Incidence of armyworm (Pseudaletia convecta) and leaf miner (Hydrellia spp.) as  
insect pests on Australian rice has also been reported (Lewin and Heenan  1985).  
However, they can also be effectively controlled through several chemical insecti- 
cides. In addition to insects, snails are important pests in rice grown in rotations  
with winter cereals (Lewin and Heenan  1985). The snails may damage the young  
rice seedlings and, thus, have the ability to affect the crop stand at early growth  
stages. Similarly, algal growth in direct-drilled and aerially sown rice also causes a  
reduction in plant growth (Lewin and Heenan  1985). The use of copper sulfate was  
found to be effective against both snails and algae (Lewin and Heenan  1985). The  
nematode, Paralongidorus australis, infestation in root zone of rice in Queensland  
resulted in poor crop growth and yield due to root syndrome (Stirling and McCulloch  
1984). Ducks are important bird pests of aerially sown rice and can be controlled  
through shooting, scare guns, and colored lights (Lewin and Heenan  1985). 
   Australia  is  relatively  safe  from  major  rice  diseases  occurring  in  other  rice-  
growing regions of the world (Cother and Lanoiselet  2003). Only a few diseases  
have been reported to cause substantial yield losses. The bacterial leaf blight was  
one of the first reported diseases in Australian rice. The bacteria Xanthomonas ory- 
zae was the causal agent of leaf blight and caused severe damage to rice crop in the

northern  territory  (Aldrick  et  al.  1973). Aggregate  sheath  blight  and  sheath  spot  
caused by Rhizoctonia oryzae-sativae and  Waitea circinata, respectively, have also  
been  reported  in  Australian  rice  (Lanoiselet  et  al.  2001,  2002a).  According  to  
Lanoiselet et al. (2005), Rhizoctonia spp. surviving in the rice fields can cause the  
disease in the following season. Although rice blast caused by Magnaporthe grisea  
has not been reported in Australia, predictive modeling (CLIMEX and DYMEX)  
has indicated that many sites in NSW have suitability for a potential outbreak of this  
devastating  disease  (Lanoiselet  et  al.  2002b).  Glume  blotch  and  stem  necrosis  
caused by Pseudomonas syringae pv.  Syringae and Pantoea ananas, respectively,  
are also important diseases of rice in Australia (Cother  1974; Cother et al. 2004).  
Stevens  et  al.  (2006)  reported  the  larvae  of  chironomid  communities  (Diptera:  
Chironomidae) to be causing substantial yield losses in rice crop in NSW. Preventive  
measures  and  chemical  control  have  been  found  to  be  effective  against  these  
pathogens. 

7.11      Harvesting, Postharvest Management, and Marketing 

Rice fields are drained out after the crop has attained a certain degree of maturity.  
The timing of draining rice fields in Australia is critical because early drainage can  
cause lodging and reduction in grain weight (Lewin and Heenan 1985). On the other  
hand, if drainage of fields is delayed, the crop remains wet at harvest and the grain  
quality is deteriorated (Lewin and Heenan  1985). Usually, the physical observation  
serves as a tool for the determination of the right time for drainage (Boerema and  
McDonald  1965). The late dough stage for lower grains in a panicle is recognized  
as an ideal stage for field drainage (Hartley et al.  1977). However, in the case of  
heavy soils, it can be done when lower grains are still in the milky stage. In Australia,  
the rice crop is harvested at 22 % grain moisture. It improves the grain quality and  
reduces losses during milling (RGA 2015). Harvesting starts in March and contin- 
ues up to May, depending upon the crop rotation. All the harvesting is done mechan- 
ically through large grain combine harvesters (RGA 2015). These harvesters remove  
straw and collect paddy (non-milled rice) in large collecting bins from where it is  
further transferred to containers attached to the operating tractors. In this way, the  
whole process of harvesting is completed in a single operation. 
   Paddy after harvesting is transferred to storage facilities through trucks. In the  
storage facilities, rice is sorted according to varieties and then kept in large bins  
where moisture contents, humidity, and temperature are regulated through computer-  
based sensors (RGA 2015). Hot conditions during storage facilitate the drying pro- 
cess. However, further processing is done in milling units. The rice is transported  
from  storage  facilities  to  mills.  In  mills,  the  dehusking  (removal  of  husk  from  
paddy) is done to obtain brown rice. Very few people prefer to consume brown rice.  
Hence, large portion of brown rice is further milled to remove bran, and white rice  
is obtained after polishing. White rice is further graded and packaged before mar- 
keting (RGA 2015). Almost all the rice produced in Australia is sold to Ricegrowers

Limited, which markets it by the brand name of SunRice. SunRice is one of the  
world biggest rice food companies which markets a large number of rice products  
across Australia and many other parts of world. A huge proportion of Australian rice  
(85 %) is exported to over 60 countries in Asia, North America, and the Middle East.  
Australian rice industry operates without any subsidies in contrast to rice industries  
of many other countries (RGA  2015). It competes with rice products from many  
countries in international markets. Every year, rice exports contribute significantly  
to Australian economy. 

7.12      Challenges and Opportunities 

Rice production in Australia is on a very limited scale. There are several constraints  
due to which the area under rice cultivation is limited. The major factor hampering  
the rice production is limited availability of irrigation water (Lewin and Heenan  
1985; Thompson 2002;  Humphreys  et  al. 2006). The  climate  is  mostly  arid  and  
water flow in the rivers is less. The rice crop requires a large amount of water and  
consumes the lion’s share out of available water resources. Although the govern- 
ment  has  imposed  many  different  restrictions  to  limit  the  rice-growing  area,  the  
changing climate and ever-depleting water resources demand further reductions in  
rice cultivation (Lewis  2012). In NSW, the rice crop uses the highest amount of  
irrigation  water,  and  many  environmentalists  are  concerned  about  the  decreased  
water flow in rivers (Thompson 2002). Not only the limited water availability but  
certain environmental factors also caused uneven water distribution. According to  
some ecologists, the reduced water flow in rivers is dangerous for aquatic life and  
biodiversity  sustained  through  it.  However,  the  Ricegrowers’  Association  of  
Australia claims that Australian rice production is purely based on resource conser- 
vation  especially  water  saving,  and  keeping  in  view  the  stats,  that  claim  is  also  
realistic (RGA 2015). As climatic conditions are not favorable throughout Australia,  
a limited area in NSW and Victoria is capable of growing rice (RGA 2015). The  
major limiting factor is temperature during the growing season (Humphreys et al.  
2006). As temperate varieties of rice are successful in Australia, the low tempera- 
tures toward their maturity cause substantial yield reductions (Horie et al.  1997).  
The terminal low temperatures affect the process of grain filling and spike sterility.  
In contrast to other rice-growing regions, the high temperatures during anthesis are  
not much harmful (Matsui et al. 2007). The poor stand establishment in dry-seeded  
rice is another emerging problem. Weed flora has also changed due to changing  
production systems. For instance, weed infestations have increased in intermittent-  
irrigated rice systems (Hill et al.  1990). These challenges have posed difficulties to  
sustainable rice production in Australia. 
   High-yielding and stress-tolerant varieties, the adoption of short-term rotations,  
water-saving sowing methods, and irrigation scheduling provide the basis for sus- 
tainable rice production in Australia under limited natural resources (Humphreys  
et al. 2006; Khan et al. 2010; Lewis 2012). Fortunately, very few of the harmful rice

7   Rice Production in Australia                                                                      181 

insect pests and diseases do exist in Australia, which is really helpful to obtain supe- 
rior  quality  production  (Thompson  2002).  The  integrated  production  regime  is  
another feature of the Australian rice industry which allows sustainable production  
without subsidies (Lewin and Heenan  1985; Thompson 2002). It also enables the  
farming community to easily market their product across the country and in the  
international markets. 

7.13       Conclusions and Future Directions 

Rice production in Australia may be regarded as a success story in terms of remark- 
able yield achievement, water and energy savings, innovative adoption of technolo- 
gies, excellent marketing and export system, and economic benefits. The integrated  
crop management and optimized postharvest processing enable Australian growers  
to obtain high-quality produce on a sustainable basis. Although the shrinking water  
resources and changing climate are haunting Australian rice production which is  
already restricted to a small area and under observation all the time, the conserva- 
tion   management   practices   adopted   by   farmers   may   help   to   sustain   this  
production.

Chapter 8 
Rice Production Systems

8.1      Introduction 

Rice is one of the major staple cereals with more than 3.5 billion people depending  
on rice for more than 20 % of their daily calorie intake (IRRI, Africa Rice and CIAT  
2010). It is estimated that the rice production must increase by 114 million tons by  
2035,  but  farmers  must  achieve  it  under  significant  threats  from  climate  change  
(Suzanne et al. 2012) coupled with decreasing amount of available agricultural land,  
labor, and water for agriculture and increased costs of all inputs. Increasing global  
food production with minimal adverse impact on resources and the environment is  
the greatest challenge for food security (Ladha et al.  2015). Hence, for ensuring  
food and nutritional security of the rice-growing world, it is essential to make con- 
sistent efforts to understand and develop innovative rice production systems that are  
resource use efficient, higher net income generating, and environment friendly. 
    This chapter attempts to summarize the information on rice production systems,  
resources used, crop productivity attained, the challenges encountered, and possible  
research needs for improving productivity in rice production systems, to meet the  
future food demands.

8.2      Rice Production Systems Classified 

Rice is grown in more than 100 countries spread across six continents and in a wide  
range of environments. Globally rice is grown on a total area of approximately 158  
million ha, producing more than 700 million tons annually (470.6 million tons of  
milled rice) in 2015 (USDA 2016). About 90 % (nearly 640 million tons) of the rice  
in the world is grown in Asia (Fig. 8.1), with China and India as the lead producers.  
Africa and Latin America produce about 25 million tons each. In Asia and sub-  
Saharan Africa, almost all rice is grown on small farms of 0.5–3 ha per household.  
Rice is produced in many different environments and in many ways. The rice pro- 
duction systems were classified by different scientists, in different countries, and in  
different ways at different times, depending on the context. The environmental and  
socioeconomic conditions of rice production vary greatly from country to country  
as well as from location to location which affected the performance of rice produc- 
tion in the past and influences the potential of improving future rice production.  
Rice  is  cultivated  under  temperate,  subtropical,  and  tropical  climatic  conditions  
with the weather varying from arid and semiarid to subhumid and humid. Based on  
soil water conditions, rice production ecosystems include irrigated lowland, irri- 
gated upland, rainfed lowland, rainfed upland, and deep water/floating ecosystems  
(Fig. 8.2). Socioeconomically, farm size cultivated by a household in South Asia,  
Southeast Asia, East Asia, and Africa is generally small, which varies from less than  
1 ha to few hectares. In the developed countries, the farm size is larger. 

8.2.1      Classification of Rice Production Systems Based  
          on the Environment Where the Rice Is Grown 

The  classifications  of  rice  environments  are  based  on  altitude  (upland,  lowland,  
deep water) and water source (irrigated or rainfed).

8   Rice Production Systems                                                               187 

 1.  Lowland rice production system – Continuously grown under flooding (paddy  
   rice). Lowlands are further categorized as: 

 (i)  Irrigated lowland production system : Irrigated lowland rice system produces  
     75 % of the global rice production from about 93 million ha. Asia has around  
     56 % of the world’s all crops in total irrigated area, of which 40–46 % is of rice.  
     Rice occupies 64–83 %, 46–52 %, and 30–35 % of the irrigated area in Southeast  
     Asia,  East Asia,  and  South Asia,  respectively  (GRiSP,  2013).  The  countries  
     with  the  largest  areas  of  irrigated  lowland  rice  are  China  (31  M  ha),  India  
     (19 M ha), Indonesia (7 M ha), and Vietnam (3 M ha) (Dobermann and Fairhurst  
     2000). Irrigated lowland rice production system is the most important rice pro- 
     duction system for food security of Asian countries. The most common method  
     of establishment of this production system is transplanting. Rice is also estab- 
     lished by direct wet or water seeding in irrigated lowland production systems.  
     In transplanting method of rice establishment, rice seedlings are raised in a rice  
     seedling nursery for 20–40 days prior to their manual or mechanical transplant- 
     ing into the flooded field. Irrigated rice is grown in bunded fields or paddies,  
     which are surrounded by a small levee that keeps the water surrounded. The  
     farmers, who have small holding (0.5 to 2 acres) of land, normally maintain in  
     the field a water layer of 5–10 centimeters (cm) during the major period of the  
     cropping cycle (Bouman et al. 2006). One or more rice crops can be grown per  
     year as the water supply is assured. Rice–rice and rice-upland cropping systems  
     are followed. Irrigated rice receives about 40 % of the world’s irrigation water

188                                                                            A.N. Rao et al. 

     and 30 % of the world’s developed freshwater resources. The average produc- 
     tivity of irrigated lowland rice is higher (about 5.4 t/ha) (GRiSP 2013). 
        Rice is grown under irrigated systems in temperate climatic conditions of  
     Australia, Bhutan, Central Asia (Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan), Chile, China,  
     Japan, Korea, Nepal, Russia, Turkey, the USA, and Uruguay (Jena and Hardy  
     2012). In Bhutan, Nepal, and part of China, rice is established by transplant- 
     ing. In the irrigated lowlands of Korea, rice is mostly established by machine  
     transplanting method with hand transplanting practiced on only 1.2 % of mar- 
     ginal  rice  land.  However,  with  decreased  labor  availability  and  rising  labor  
     cost, farmers are motivated to shift from transplanting to direct seeding as is  
     practiced  in  other  temperate  rice-growing  countries.  In  temperate  climatic  
     regions where a single irrigated rice crop is grown per year, productivity of  
     8–10     t/ha   or   more     is   achieved     (http://ricepedia.org/rice-as-a-crop/ 
     where-is-rice-grown). 
 (ii)  Rainfed lowland production system (including flood prone) : Rainfed lowland  
     rice is grown in river deltas and coastal areas of South Asia, parts of Southeast  
     Asia, and essentially all of Africa, where the fields are bunded and flooded with  
     rainwater for at least a part of the cropping season. In this system, the major  
     method of rice establishment is transplanting, but direct wet or dry seeding is  
     also practiced. Globally, around 19 % of the world’s rice is produced from 52  
     million ha of rainfed lowlands (GRiSP 2013). Abiotic stresses, such as drought  
     (in around 27 million ha) and uncontrolled flooding ranging from short- duration  
     flash floods to deep water submergence with 100 cm of water for a few months  
     (20 million ha), prevail due to highly uncertain rainfall and salinity (Dobermann  
     and  Fairhurst  2000;  Bouman  et  al.  2005; Wassmann  et  al.  2009;  Clermont-  
     Dauphin et al. 2010; Mackill et al. 2010). Water is 1 to 5 m deep and is supplied  
     by rivers, lakes, or tides in river mouth deltas. Water depth may exceed 5 m in  
     some parts of Bangladesh, as well as in the Mekong, Kariba Dam (Tongas), and  
     Niger  deltas.  Deep  water  or  floating  rice  is  established  by  broadcasting  rice  
     seed in plowed fields and is normally grown unbunded, in regions where the  
     water level rises quickly after the beginning of the monsoon. Traditional long  
     tiller and few sprout varieties are cultivated. The rice plants elongate and float  
     as the floodwater advances; thus, it is named as “floating rice.” Due to the risk  
     involved in growing rice in these most difficult environments, farmers tend to  
     use fertilizers rarely and avoid using improved rice varieties. Thus the rice pro- 
     ductivity  in  rainfed  lowland  areas  is  very  low  (1–2.5  t/ha)  (Dobermann  and  
     Fairhurst 2000). 

 2.  Rainfed upland rice production system – In this system the rice is grown under  
   high rainfall. Rainfed upland rice production system is often used by subsistence  
   farmers in Asia, Africa, and Central America. It can be found in environments  
   ranging from low-lying valley bottoms to steep sloping lands with high runoff.  
   The rice in this system is established by broadcasting or dibbling in dry soil prior  
   to the onset of monsoon or during the rainy season. The aerobic condition pre- 
   vails in the soil throughout the rice cropping season. Traditionally, one rice crop

8  Rice Production Systems                                                           189 

   is grown annually with minimal input application. Of rice produced in around 15  
   million ha, rainfed uplands account for about 4 % of the global total rice produc- 
   tion  (GRiSP  2013).  Two-third  of  rainfed  upland  rice  is  in Asia  (Bangladesh,  
   Cambodia, China, India, Indonesia, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam). In the  
   rice belt of Africa, upland areas of central and western part represent about 40 %  
   of the African area under rice cultivation and employ about 70 % of the region’s  
   rice farmers (Bouman et al. 2007). The ecosystem is extremely diverse, includ- 
   ing fields that are level, gently rolling, or steep, at altitudes of up to 2000 m and  
   with rainfall ranging from 1000 to 4500 mm annually. Soils range from highly  
   fertile to highly weathered, infertile, and acidic, but only 15 % of total upland  
   rice grows where soils are fertile and the growing season is long. The productiv- 
   ity of upland rainfed rice is low (about 1 t/ha) because of many biotic, abiotic,  
   and social constraints and the use of the local varieties by farmers that fail to  
   respond to improved management practices. The major constraints of this sys- 
   tem are drought, problem soils, and pests (weeds, diseases, insects, nematodes)  
   (Bouman et al. 2007; GRiSP 2013). 
 3.  Irrigated upland or aerobic rice production system – In aerobic rice systems, the  
   rice plant is established by direct seeding in non-puddled, non-flooded fields and  
   managed intensively as an upland crop (Tuong and Bouman 2003). Aerobic rice  
   systems can reduce water requirements for rice production by over 44 % relative  
   to conventionally transplanted systems, by reducing percolation, seepage, and  
   evaporation  losses,  while  maintaining  yields  at  an  acceptable  level  (Bouman  
   et al. 2005). There were efforts in the 1980s to develop and popularize the irri- 
   gated upland rice or aerobic rice production in Brazil using sprinkler irrigation  
   systems. In northern China, aerobic rice production is being practiced currently  
   at a limited scale in freely drained fields, as a response to water shortage. The  
   areas planted with aerobic rice varieties were estimated to be about 80,000 ha in  
   China and 250,000 ha in Brazil (http://www.fao.org/agriculture /crops /thematic-  
   sitemap/   theme/spi/scpi-home/managing-ecosystems/sustainable-rice-systems/ 
   rice-what/en/). In India, the aerobic rice system adoption has been initiated in  
   states like Karnataka (Rao et al. 2015). 

8.2.2      Classification of Rice Production Systems Based  
          on the Method of Rice Establishment 

The major methods of rice establishment in the world are transplanting and direct  
seeding. Thus, based on the method of rice establishment, the rice production sys- 
tems may be categorized as (a) transplanted rice (TPR) production systems and (b)  
direct-seeded rice production systems. Direct-seeded rice production systems may  
be further categorized as (i) dry-seeded rice (dry-DSR) production system, (ii) wet-  
seeded rice (wet-DSR) production system, and (iii) water-seeded rice (water-DSR)  
production system. These production systems are briefly described below.

8.2.2.1      Transplanted Rice (TPR) Production System 

Rice is commonly grown by transplanting seedlings into the puddled soil (wet till- 
age) in lowlands of Asia (e.g., India, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Myanmar) and Africa  
(e.g., Madagascar, Mali). Transplanting of rice is done manually (Fig.  8.3) or by  
machine (Fig. 8.4). The manual transplanting method involves growing of seedlings  
in a nursery and replanting of 20–30-day-old rice seedlings to puddled soils. The rice  
seedling nursery may be raised on wet bed or dry bed or dapog or mat or modified  
mat methods depending on the locality, soil type, rice ecosystem, and the resource  
availability  (for  details,  refer  to  http://www.knowledgebank.irri.org/step- by- step- 
production/growth/planting).  In  several Asian  countries,  the  labor-intensive  trans- 
planted rice production systems are being practiced until now, where even the labor  
supply is abundant due to the population growth. For machine transplanting the rice  
seedlings are grown in trays or in mat-type nursery in which a thin layer of sol mixed  
with farm yard manure or compost is placed on a polythene sheet and rice seedlings  
are raised. Mats of rice seedlings from the trays or mat-type nursery are used for  
machine transplanting. In Asia, machine transplanters are now being used to estab- 
lish rice crops in China, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan. In India, farmers started using it  
in states like Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. The traditional TPR production system  

Fig.  8.3   The  manual  transplanting  method  of  rice  establishment  uses  more  labor,  water,  and  
energy as it involves processes such as rice seedling nursery raising, seedling pulling, and trans- 
planting in flooded soil conditions (Photos by A.N. Rao)

8   Rice Production Systems                                                                    191 

has advantages such as adequate nutrient availability (e.g., phosphorus, zinc, iron)  
due to creation of anaerobic conditions (Sanchez  1973), assured seedling establish- 
ment, initial seedling vigor, and competitiveness against weeds (Rao et al.  2007).  
However, higher quantities of water are consumed in TPR in order to accomplish the  
processes  such  as  puddling,  surface  evaporation,  and  percolation  (Farooq  et  al.  
2011). This production system is labor, water, and energy intensive and is becoming  
less profitable as these resources are becoming increasingly scarce. It also deterio- 
rates the physical properties of soil, adversely affects the performance of succeeding  
upland  crops,  and  contributes  to  methane  emissions.  However, TPR  continues  to  
dominate under certain environmental and socioeconomic conditions of the world. 

8.2.2.2     Direct-Seeded Rice (DSR) Production System 

Direct seeding of rice is done by (1) dry seeding (dry-DSR), (2) wet seeding (wet-  
DSR), and (3) water seeding (water-DSR) (Kumar and Ladha  2011). As the rice  
seeds are sown directly, the dry- , wet- and water-DSR methods are often jointly  
referred to as DSR. At present 23 % of rice area is direct-seeded globally (Rao et al.  

Fig. 8.4   Rice establishment by using transplanting machine reduces the drudgery of women labor,  
reduces the cost of cultivation, and ensures optimum rice plant population (Photos by A.N. Rao) 

----------------------- Page 197-----------------------

192                                                                                A.N. Rao et al. 

2007;  Kumar  and  Ladha  2011).  Dry-DSR  consists  of  sowing  dry  seeds  on  dry  
(unsaturated) soils. Seeds can be broadcasted, drilled, or dibbled. Dry-DSR produc- 
tion is practiced traditionally in most of the Asian countries in rainfed upland eco- 
systems and is also used in irrigated areas with precise water control as aerobic rice.  
In certain states of India, farmers are cultivating dry-DSR with the onset of mon- 
soon and convert it to irrigated lowland rice after release of the assured canal water  
in the system (Fig. 8.5) (Rao et al. 2015). Dry-DSR and TPR in the furrow-irrigated  
raised-bed planting system were also tested (Singh et al. 2006, 2008) for attaining  
optimal water productivity in the rice–wheat system in the Indo-Gangetic Plains of  
South Asia. However, rice establishment on furrow-irrigated raised-beds is not cur- 
rently popular among the rice farming community. 
    Wet-DSR involves sowing of pre-germinated rice seeds in wet (saturated) pud- 
dled soils. Wet- DSR is done by broadcasting the seeds on puddled soil or by using  
a drum seeder (Fig. 8.6). Wet-DSR is practiced in favorable rainfed lowlands and  
irrigated area with good facility of drainage as in Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, the  
Philippines, and Sri Lanka (Pandey and Velasco 2005; Weerakoon et al. 2011). DSR  
is becoming an attractive alternative to TPR. Asian rice farmers are shifting to DSR  
to reduce labor input, drudgery, and cultivation cost (Rao et al.  2007; Kumar and  
Ladha,  2011).The increased availability of short-duration rice varieties and cost-  
efficient selective herbicides has encouraged farmers to try this method of establish- 
ing  rice  (Balasubramanian  and  Hill  2002).  It  is  quickly  replacing  traditional

transplanting in areas with good drainage and water control (Balasubramanian and  
Hill 2002). Rice is mostly direct-seeded, with only 6 % area under transplanting, in  
Latin America (GRiSP 2013). In the water-DSR, pre-germinated rice seeds (soaked  
and incubated for 24 h each) are broadcast in standing water on puddled (wet-water-  
DSR) or unpuddled soil (dry-water-DSR). The relatively heavyweight rice seeds  
sink  in  standing  water,  resulting  in  good  anchorage. Water-DSR  is  used  for  rice  
establishment in irrigated lowland areas with good land leveling as in California  
(United States), Australia, and European countries specifically for managing prob- 
lematic  weeds  such  as  weedy  rice.  In  Asia,  some  countries  like  Malaysia  are  
 adopting it. 
    In this chapter, the method of rice establishment is considered as the major crite- 
ria for classifying rice production systems. The information of these rice production  
systems on the attained crop productivity, the resources used, and the challenges  
encountered will be discussed while highlighting the possible research needs for  
improving productivity in rice production systems to meet the future food demands. 

8.3      Productivity of Different Rice Production Systems 

Several studies have shown that productivity of TPR and DSR rice will be similar in  
a given environment provided that they are cultivated using best management prac- 
tices  (Rickman  et  al.  2001;  Mitchell  et  al.  2004;  Kumar  and  Ladha  2011).  
Traditionally under rainfed TPR areas, need of ponded water for customary practice  
of puddling delays rice transplanting by 1–3 weeks (Ladha et al. 2009) resulting in  
reduced yields. The puddled TPR production systems need a large quantity of water  
and  labor,  which  are  becoming  scarce  and  costly,  in  addition  to  the  drudgery  to  
transplanting  women  and  children. The  profit  margins  were  also  reduced  due  to  
increasing water and labor cost for TPR (Pandey and Velasco 1999). Hence, a major  
shift from puddled TPR production system to DSR system is taking place in the  

----------------------- Page 199-----------------------

194                                                                            A.N. Rao et al. 

irrigated areas of many developing countries in Asia (Pandey and Velasco  2005 ,  
Rao et al. 2007). However, compared to TPR, lower yield was reported with wet-  
and dry-DSR production systems due to uneven or poor crop establishment; inade- 
quate weed control; higher spikelet sterility than in puddled transplanting; higher  
crop lodging, especially in wet seeding and broadcasting; and micronutrient defi- 
ciencies (Rickman et al. 2001; Rao et al. 2007; Choudhury et al. 2007; Singh et al.  
2005). Higher rice productivity was reported when these constraints were alleviated  
(Bhushan et al. 2007; Yoshinaga 2005). 
   The  performance  of  different  types  of  DSR  production  systems  varied  with  
countries depending on the cultural practices used, the environment, and their inter- 
action (Kumar and Ladha 2011). Among DSR production systems, line/drill seed- 
ing (compared with broadcasting) and wet-DSR (compared with dry-DSR) were  
reported  to  yield  higher.  However,  dry-DSR  was  found  to  be  more  resistant  to  
drought with longer survival under drought period and may increase yield stability  
of rainfed rice than the wet-DSR and transplanted rice systems (Boling et al. 1998).  
The yield of dry-DSR and TPR systems were similar when irrigation was scheduled  
daily or at 20 kPa (Yadav et al. 2011a). In China, a meta-analysis revealed that the  
rice grain yield decreased in rice–rice cropping system and increased in rice-upland  
cropping system due to the adoption of zero tillage (ZT) (Huang et al. 2015), when  
compared to conventional tillage (CT). The responses of rice grain yield to ZT did  
not differ with rice establishment method (TPR or DSR), rice cultivar type (hybrid  
or inbred), ZT adoption duration (<3 years or 3–6 years or >6 years), and manage- 
ment of crop residues (residues removed or retained) (Huang et al. 2015). 
   Based on the data of several studies they reviewed, Kumar and Ladha (2011)  
reported that direct-seeded rice production systems had a lower cost of production  
by US$ 22–80 ha−1 resulting in higher economic returns of US$30–50 ha−1compared  

with conventional puddled TPR production system. They reported the savings in  
production  costs  increased  in  the  following  order:  ZT-dry-DSR  >  Bed-dry-DSR  
>CT-dry-DSR > CT-wet-DSR > CT-TPR. 

8.4      Resource Use of Different Rice Production Systems 

High cost of production and diminishing resources have led to a greater focus on  
improving the overall eco-efficiencies of agricultural systems (Keating et al. 2010)  
for achieving optimal agricultural outputs using less land, water, nutrients, energy,  
labor, and capital inputs in rice production systems. 

8.4.1      Water 

Irrigated lowland rice is typically grown under flooded conditions, and at the field  
level, it utilizes up to two to three times more water than other major food crops, due  
to the unproductive water flows, in the form of seepage and percolation to drains,

8   Rice Production Systems                                                                       195 

creeks,  or  groundwater. This  can  amount  to  60–80  %  of  all  water  inputs  to  rice  
(Tabbal et al. 2002). The water input for a typical puddled TPR per season was esti- 
mated to vary from 660 to 5280 mm depending on the growing season, climatic  
conditions, soil type, and hydrological conditions, with 1000–2000 mm as a typical  
value in most cases (Tuong and Bouman 2003). The overexploitation of groundwa- 
ter to meet the high water requirement of TPR and water scarcity has become a  
major  threat  to  the  sustainability  of  rice  production  (Rijsberman  2006). The  per  
capita availability of water is expected to decline by 15–54 % over the next 35 years  
in several countries of Asia (Gleick  1993), and by 2025, 15–20 million ha of rice  
lands will suffer some degree of water scarcity (GriSP  2013). Hence, increasing  
water use efficiency in rice production systems is essential (Ladha et al. 2015). In  
addition to the consumption of large amount of irrigation water and labor, the pro- 
cess of puddling results in subsurface compaction (Kukal and Aggarwal 2003). 
    The increasing shortage of water resources has led to the development and adop- 
tion of aerobic rice system, which saves water input and increases water productiv- 
ity by reducing water use during land preparation and limiting seepage, percolation,  
and evaporation (Nie et al. 2012). In an aerobic rice system, the crop can be dry  
direct-seeded or transplanted and soils are kept aerobic through the major part of the  
growing season. Supplemental irrigation is applied when needed. Aerobic rice cul- 
tivars are adapted to aerobic soils and have higher yield potential than traditional  
                                                    -1 
upland cultivars. Grain yields of 5–6 t ha   can be reached in aerobic rice system  
(Nie et al. 2012).The micronutrient deficiencies such as Zn and Fe in aerobic rice  
are of major concern (Gao et al. 2006). Aerobic rice could considerably improve  
eco-efficiency in rice-based systems where water, labor, and energy are becoming  
increasingly scarce, and hence it is gaining importance in South Asia as an alterna- 
tive to the conventional transplanted flooded rice system (Mahajan et al. 2013). 
    Dry-DSR production system helps to save irrigation water, especially in fine-  
textured soils (Yadav et al. 2011a, b). Dry-DSR with intermittent irrigation offers  
potential water savings at the field level due to reduced evaporation losses, intermit- 
tent irrigation, and avoidance of puddling. In dry-DSR and TPR production sys- 
tems,  significant  irrigation  water  input  decline  was  recorded  with  irrigation  at  
20 kPa compared to daily irrigation (Yadav et al.  2011a). Novel irrigation water-  
saving technologies such as alternate wetting and drying (AWD) can also help many  
rice farmers around the world to cope with water scarcity (Lampayan et al. 2015).  
In AWD, irrigation is given at intervals of 6–8 days for heavy soils and 4–5 days for  
lighter soils. Prior to next irrigation, the soil dries naturally after the water disap- 
pearance from soil surface and the water quantity applied at each of the irrigation is  
about 50–60 mm. Thus, the introduction of aerobic periods during the growing sea- 
son and altering soil chemistry and flooding practices results in reduced water use  
(Yao et al. 2012; Liu et al. 2013) and reduced global warming potential (GWP) of  
greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes (Feng et al. 2013). A 10–77 % saving in water and  
20–87 % increase in rice yield with the additional advantages of energy saving,  
nutrient use efficiencies, and controlling vectors of malaria and Japanese encephali- 
tis were reported with the use of AWD (Van der Hoek et al. 2001). The irrigation at  
20 kPa lowered the irrigation water use of dry-DSR, with AWD, by 33–53 % as  
compared to the respective transplanted rice system (Yadav et al., 2011a).

8.4.2      Nutrients  

Of  all  the  nutrients,  nitrogen  (N),  phosphorus  (P O ),  and  potassium  (K O) 2 5           2 
remain  the  major  nutrients  for  increased  and  sustained  rice  productivity.  The  
fertilizer use trend in rice indicates the highest consumptions of N fertilizer fol- 
lowed by P O  and K O fertilizers with imbalanced fertilizer use (i.e., very high 2 5 2 
use of N, less use of P O , and negligible use of K O, S, and micronutrients), 2 5 2 
increased soil nutrient mining, and decreased soil organic matter and soil fertility  
(FAO 2006). Proper nutrient management should aim to supply fertilizers ade- 
quate for the demand of the rice and applied in ways that minimize loss, maxi- 
mize the efficiency of use, and improve the productivity and sustainability of rice  
production  systems,  because  of  the  high  potential  for  loss  and  economic  and  
environmental consequences (Chien et al. 2009). The nutrient management strat- 
egies for irrigated and rainfed lowland rice production systems vary (Dobermann  
and White  1999). 
    Among macronutrients, N is a key nutrient for the optimal rice growth and devel- 
opment to attain optimal rice yield. The rice crop and water management practices  
for DSR differ considerably from those for TPR. The DSR may have higher nitro- 
gen  requirement  due  to  the  longer  duration  of  DSR  in  fields  than  puddle  trans- 
planted rice (Kumar and Ladha  2011).The insufficient N uptake by the DSR crop  
and resulting lower yield observed in DSR production systems (Kropff et al. 1994)  
was reported to be due to relatively lower uptake of nitrogen by the shallower roots  
of DSR (Zhang and Wang 2002) and higher leaching losses of applied nitrogen out  
of root zone in DSR (Ponnamperuma 1972). Increasing nitrogen quantity in DSR in  
larger number of splits with optimum irrigation may lead to higher rice yield due to  
their effect on the nitrogen movement and availability to plants in soils especially in  
coarse- and medium-textured soils (Shad and De Datta  1988). 
    N is applied in the larger quantities compared to all other nutrients as most soils  
of rice production systems are nitrogen deficient. As per global estimates, the fer- 
tilizer N recovery by the crop averages only 46 % in rice systems (Ladha et al.  
2005). To increase the N use efficiency of irrigated rice, site-specific N manage- 
ment (SSNM) was developed (Dobermann et al. 2002), in which N application is  
based  on  the  demand  of  the  crop  for  N  as  measured  by  the  chlorophyll  meter  
(SPAD) or leaf color chart (Peng et al. 1996). The usefulness of leaf color chart for  
dry-DSR   rainfed   lowland   rice   and   wet-DSR   was   reported   by   Budhar   and  
Tamilselvan  (2003)  and Angadi  et  al.  (2002).  SSNM  was  evaluated  in  farmers’  
fields in eight major irrigated rice domains in Asia, and the average grain yield  
increased by 11 % with an increase in average recovery efficiency from 31 % to  
40  %  and  20  %  of  all  farmers  achieving  more  than  50  %  recovery  efficiency  
(Dobermann et al. 2002). Enhanced efficiency nitrogen fertilizers have been devel- 
oped to decrease N losses and improve N use efficiency in rice production systems  
(Linquist et al. 2013). 
    On an average, around 18 kg ha−1 of K O for the irrigated rice crop is needed  
                                                      2 

(Dobermann and Cassman  1997). K O deficiency has become a constraint in soils 2

8   Rice Production Systems                                                                  197 

that were previously not considered as K O limiting. The occurrence of K O defi-2      2 
ciency  and  response  to  applied  K O  depend  on  the  yield  levels,  K O  buffering 2 2 
capacity of the soil, straw management, and net K O inputs from sources other than 2 
fertilizer (Dobermann et al.  1996). Clay mineralogy, texture, and K O inputs from 2 
irrigation  or  rainwater  are  needed  to  be  considered  along  with  K O  inputs  from 2 
other sources while formulating a rational K O management strategy for the rice 2 
production systems (Dobermann et al.  1998). 
    In  the  irrigated  rice  production  systems,  P O   solubilizes  immediately  after 2 5 
flooding,  leading  to  an  increase  in  available  P O   to  rice  (Kirk  et  al.  1990). 2 5 
However, soil drying reduces its availability to crop (Willet and Higgens  1978;  
Sah  et  al.  1989).  Hence,  phosphorus  deficiency  is  important  in  drought-prone  
environments because the mobility of P O  decreases sharply as soil dries. In sys-2 5 
tems of low P O  fertility, the repeated dry-wet transition increases P O  extrac-2 5 2 5 
tion, further lowering fertility. The upland rice dry-DSR is generally grown on  
poorly  fertile,  strongly  weathered  soil,  with  high  P O   fixation  and  severe  soil 2 5 
acidity. P O  deficiency is one of the key constraints of upland dry-DSR produc-2 5 
tion (Gupta and O’Toole  1986). Banding of P O  fertilizer beneath the dry-DSR 2 5 
crop row is preferred. 
    The deficiency of secondary and micronutrients is often stimulated by the appli- 
cation of large amounts of N, P O , and K O for achieving higher rice yield targets 2 5 2 
(Johnston et al. 2009). Iron (Fe) is only slightly soluble in the soil under aerobic  
conditions, especially in alkaline calcareous soils (Marschner  1995). Fe deficiency  
is a common nutritional problem in the production of aerobic rice. Current crop  
management strategies addressing Fe deficiency include Fe foliar application, plant  
breeding for enriched Fe rice varieties, and adoption of cropping systems (Zuo and  
Zhang 2011). Across the globe, among micronutrients, zinc (Zn) deficiency is one  
of  the  important  abiotic  factors  limiting  rice  productivity  in  addition  to  being  a  
major nutritional disorder affecting human health (Alloway 2009). Zn deficiency is  
wide spread in traditional lowland (Dobermann and Fairhurst 2000) due to high soil  
pH and high carbonate content as well as low redox potential (Forno et al.  1975;  
Alloway 2009). Shifting the method of establishment from TPR to DSR or aerobic  
rice system and adoption of water-saving technologies like AWD may decrease Zn  
availability (Gao et al. 2006). Soil or foliar Zn fertilizers application is used to man- 
age Zn deficiency (Rengel et al. 1999) and to increase grain Zn concentration (Jiang  
et al. 2008). It is essential to utilize breeding programs to increase Zn uptake and  
utilization  in  rice  production  systems  as  a  large  genotypic  variation  (13.5– 
58.4 mg kg–1) was recorded in Zn grain concentration with differential rice  genotypic  

responses to Zn deficiency (Graham et al.  1999; Quijano-Guerta et al. 2002; Shi  
et al. 2009; Gao et al. 2009). 
    It  is  essential  to  have  a  proper  blend  of  organic  and  inorganic  fertilizers  for  
increasing the productivity of rice production systems and for improving soil health.  
Application of SSNM can help improve nutrient management in rice production  
systems and attain improved yields and profitability as SSNM is based on scientific  
principles for optimal site-specific and need-based supply of nutrients to rice in a  
particular cropping season.

8.5      Pests (Insects, Diseases, and Weeds) and Their  
        Management in Different Rice Production Systems 

The estimated average potential yield loss in major crops globally is 18 %, 16 %,  
and 34 % due to animal pests, (non-virus) pathogens, and weeds, respectively, in the  
absence of any physical, biological, or chemical crop protection (Oerke 2006). The  
potentially highest yield loss causing weeds are more problematic in the DSR pro- 
duction system than in puddled TPR production system. The young emerging rice  
seedlings of DSR do not possess a competitive advantage over weeds as do have the  
transplanted 30-day-old seedlings in the TPR. Moreover, a layer of water suppresses  
the initial flushes of weeds in TPR, and lack of flooding in DSR provides a competi- 
tive  advantage  to  weeds  over  rice  seedlings  in  DSR  (Rao  et  al.  2007,  Rao  and  
Nagamani  2007).  In  addition  to  currently  problematic  weeds  such  Echinochloa  
spp., weedy rice is becoming a major threat to dry-DSR production systems which  
replaced traditional transplanted rice production systems (Rao and Nagamani 2007).  
Hence, integrated weed management strategies are to be developed for managing  
the weedy-rice problem in dry-DSR production systems. 
   A study in tropical Asia covering a wide range of lowland rice-cultivating envi- 
ronments revealed that the injury profiles were dominated by stem rot and sheath  
blight; bacterial leaf blight, plant hoppers, and leaf folder; and sheath rot, brown  
spot, leaf blast, and neck blast (Savary et al. 2000). Stem rot and sheath blight were  
associated with high (mineral) fertilizer inputs, long fallow periods, low pesticide  
use, and good water management in (mostly) transplanted rice crops of a rice–rice  
rotation. Bacterial leaf blight, plant hoppers, and leaf folder were more prevalent in  
direct-seeded rice–rice production system with poor water management and lower  
fertilizer and pesticide input use or with adequate water management and higher  
fertilizer and pesticide input usage. Sheath rot, brown spot, leaf blast, and neck blast  
correspond  to  low-input,  labor-intensive  (hand  weeding  and  transplanting)  rice  
crops in a diverse rotation system with uncertain water supply. Weed infestation is  
an  omnipresent  constraint.  The  high  weed  pressure,  severe  iron  deficiency,  and  
nematode infestation coupled with higher irrigation water inputs were reported to  
be the reasons for getting rice yields lower than the transplanted rice by the adoption  
of dry-seeded rice with most frequent irrigations on coarse- and medium-textured  
soils (Singh et al. 2015). 
   The rice production systems were reported to differ in the incidence and losses  
caused due to the pests. A Korean study revealed higher population densities of  
green  rice  leafhopper  (Nephotettix  cincticeps)  and  leaf  folders  (Cnaphalocrocis  
medinalis) in machine-transplanted than in direct-seeded rice, while abundance of  
brown plant hopper (Nilaparvata lugens) and small brown plant hopper (Laodelphax  
striatellus) was more in dry-DSR (Lee and Ma  1997). However, incidence of the  
Asiatic rice borer or striped rice stem borer (Chilo suppressalis), white-backed plant  
hopper (WBPH) (Sogatella furcifera), and rice stem maggot (Chlorops oryzae) did  
not differ among machine-transplanted and direct-seeded rice production systems  
(Lee and Ma  1997). In Punjab (India), the leaf folder incidence was higher in the

8   Rice Production Systems                                                                    199 

bed-transplanted (BT) (8.87 %) and wet-seeded rice (WSR) (10.62 %) than that in  
rice grown using the other crop establishment methods (Sarao and Mahal  2013).  
The incidence of stem borer causing dead heart damage was significantly higher in  
the WSR system (5.85 %), while that of whitehead damage was higher in the BT  
(5.89 %) and WSR (6.54 %) plots than in other rice production systems. In Korea,  
sheath blight (Rhizoctonia solani) incidence was not affected by different rice pro- 
duction  systems,  while  the  incidence  of  rice  blast  (Magnaporthe  grisea)  was  
affected and favored by unbalanced nutrient contents in the rice plants (especially  
low SiO  and high nitrogen) and high leaf area index (LAI) (Kim et al. 1996).2 
    Integrated weed management strategies are available for managing weeds of dif- 
ferent rice production systems (Rao  2010; Rao and Ladha 2011,  2013; Rao and  
Nagamani 2007, 2010; Rao et al. 2007, 2015). The management aspects of the dis- 
eases and insect pests of rice are dealt with in other chapters of this book. 

8.6      Environmental Footprint by Different Rice Production  
        Systems 

Among different sectors that contribute to total greenhouse gas emissions of the  
world, contribution of agriculture is around 9.3 %, including 1.5 % of rice. Emissions  
of  greenhouse  gases  (GHGs)  from  rice  fields  are  common  in  South,  East,  and  
Southeast Asia. Rice ecosystems emit both CH  and N O and have higher global 4 2 
warming potential (GWP) of GHG emissions and have higher GWP   (GWP per Y 
unit of yield) than other crops as rice is grown usually under flooded conditions in  
irrigated ecosystems and uses more water (Linquist et al. 2012). 
    Due to individual or combined effects of various factors such as soil characteris- 
tics,  climatic  conditions,  and  management  such  as  soil  pH,  redox  potential,  soil  
texture, soil salinity, temperature, rainfall, and water management, amount of CH  4 
emission varies between different rice production systems depending on the rice  
establishment techniques (Harada et al. 2007; Ladha et al. 2015). The irrigated pud- 
dled TPR is considered one of the major sources of methane (CH ) emissions and 4 
accounts for 10–20 % (50–100 Tg year  −1) of total global annual CH  emissions  
                                                                                    4 

(Reiner and Aulakh 2000). Direct seeding has the potential to decrease CH  emis-4 
sions (Wassmann et al. 2004). CH  emissions were reported to be lower in DSR than 4 
with  conventional  TPR  (Gupta  et  al.  2002;  Tyagi  et  al.  2010).  In  wet-DSR,  the  
reduction in CH  emission increased from 16–22 % under continuous flooding to 4 
82–92  %  under  mid-season  drainage  or  intermittent  irrigation  as  compared  with  
conventional TPR under continuous flooding (Corton et al. 2000). CH  gas emission 4 
and global warming potential were maximum under conventional TPR, and emis- 
sion of N O was maximum under DSR crop with conservation practice of brown 2 
manuring as the addition of organic matter to soil increased the decomposition rate,  
which resulted in higher emission of GHGs (Bhatia et al. 2011). One of the ways, to  
minimize CH  emissions while attaining equivalent or higher rice yield and lower 4 
irrigation water use than those of farmer-managed puddled TPR, is adoption of dry-

DSR with best management practices and conservation agriculture (CA) that uses  
ZT or minimum till while retaining rotational crop residues (Ladha et al.  2015).  
Izaurralde et al. (2004) opined that soils under ZT, depending on the management,  
might also emit less nitrous oxide. 

8.7      Challenges and Future Research Needs of Different Rice  
        Production Systems 

The challenges vary with the rice production systems. The main factors that limit  
the  yield  in  irrigated  areas  include  poor  management  of  inputs  and  resources;  
losses from weeds, pests, and diseases; inadequate land and water scarcity; and  
resulting salinity and alkalinity. In rainfed lowlands the challenges include adverse  
climate, drought, submergence, poor soils, pests, weeds, and absence of appropri- 
ate soil, water, crop management technologies, or strategies to suit the farmers’  
needs  and  which  economically  increase  rice  productivity.  In  upland  dry-DSR  
environment, the major challenges are the biological constraints such as weeds,  
nematodes,  and  diseases  (e.g.,  blast),  poor  soil  fertility,  socioeconomic  con- 
straints, and lack of productive varieties to suit the microenvironment of uplands  
and the drought. In TPR production systems, inappropriate management of prob- 
lem soils, non-judicious use of fertilizers and water, and resulting pest prolifera- 
tions  and  increasing  cost  of  cultivation  are  major  challenges.  In  aerobic  rice  
production systems, lack of fine-tuned need-based technologies suited to different  
rice ecosystems across globe, non- availability of suitable varieties, micronutrient  
deficiencies,  soil  and  water  management  optimization,  adaptive  weed  menace,  
and pest problems are major challenges. 
   The future research efforts on rice production systems should ultimately result in  
(i) evolving practical integrated crop management strategies that improve rice pro- 
ductivity and production efficiently, effectively, and economically in different rice  
production  systems  across  the  globe  and  (ii)  improving  the  food  security  and  
 livelihood of the farmers and farming community of rice and rice-based cropping  
systems globally.

9.1      Introduction 

Rice can be cultivated under a wide range of climatic conditions including those of  
plains near to sea levels as well as the Himalayas region which is 2700 m above the  
sea level (Fuller et al. 2010). The natural progenitors of crop species provide informa- 
tion regarding the evolution of relevant species and are a source of genetic variation  
(Kovach et al. 2007). Evidences of rice domestication have been collected from the  
regions between the lower and middle Yangtze River in south of China (Doebley et al.  
2006). Recently, Civáň et al. (2015) concluded that there were three different indepen- 
dent centers of rice domestications in different regions of Asia. Wild and domesticated  
rice types differ for several of the traits such as shattering behavior, pericarp color,

    All across the world, the cultivated rice includes two species which are African  
rice (Oryza glaberrima) and Asian rice (Oryza sativa). African rice is grown mainly  
in African countries, while Asian rice is generally grown to the rest of the world  
including some parts of Africa. The two Oryza species have been grown for centu- 
ries which helped in improving their traits for achieving a better growth and yield.  
Based  on  study  of  3000  accession,  O.  sativa  categories  into  four  main  classes:  
Indica, Japonica, Aus, and Aromatic types. In this chapter, we have discussed the  
history of rice domestication, the domestication traits, rice types, and rice cultivars  
in the world. 

9.2        History of Rice Domestication from Its Wild Ancestor 

Wild rice was probably found throughout the eastern China and Yangtze basin up to  
the north such as Shandong. Besides, silicon microfossils and phytoliths of structures  
of rice cell that dated to 11,000–12,000 BC have been discovered at Diotonghuan and  
Xianrendong sites. During 3000–2000 BC, rice was moved to the Yellow River basin  
which  is  located  in  central  China.  For  the  same  period  (2500–2000  BC),  the  rice  
remains were found in Vietnam and Taiwan. In India, archeological work indicated  
that rice consumption existed in Neolithic site Lahuradewa in the Ganges Valley (i.e.,  
dating to 7000–5000 BC) (Fuller et al. 2010; Itzstein-Davey et al. 2007; Sweeney and  
McCouch 2007; Wei et al. 2012). Archeological data and molecular clock estimation  
indicate that the domestication of rice was started ∼8200–13,500 years ago, and rice  
was first cultivated in the Yangtze Valley of China (Molina et al. 2011). 

9.2.1        History and Domestication of Asian and African Rice  

Cultivated crop species derived from their wild ancestors not only provide valuable  
sources for genetic diversity for crop improvement but also provide a valuable infor- 
mation to get a glance at the evolutionary history of our domesticated crop species  
(Kovach et al. 2007). Domesticated rices have 21 wild relatives of the genus Oryza.  
The genus  Oryza is divided into four species complexes:  O. sativa, O. ridleyi, O.  
granulata, and  O. officinalis species (Vaughan et al.  2003). Six wild species are  
included in  O. sativa complex, i.e.,  O. rufipogon, O. barthii, O. glumaepatula, O.  
nivara (considered to be an ecotype of  O. rufipogon), O. meridionalis, and  O. lon- 
gistaminata, and two domesticated species in the complex are O. glaberrima and O.  
sativa. All these species are diploids. O. longistaminata and  O. barthii are African  
species;  O. barthii is widespread in West Africa, and  O. longistaminata is found  
throughout Africa. O. meridionalis is inhabitant to Australia, and  O. glumaepatula  
is widespread in Central and South America.  O. rufipogon established throughout  
Oceania and Asia. These distributions are helpful to trace the inherited pools of rice  
varieties (Vaughan et al. 2003; Sweeney and McCouch 2007).

9   Domestication and Development of Rice Cultivars                                                     209 

    There are two divergent types of domesticated rice, Asian rice (Oryza sativa) and  
African rice (Oryza glaberrima), which have distinctive domestication histories. A  
hypothesis indicated that  O. sativa was probably domesticated from  O. rufipogon  
approximately 10,000 years ago by East Asian people (Wei et al. 2012). O. sativa is  
subdivided into indica and japonica , two main subspecies (Fuller et al. 2010). It had  
been suggested by several researchers that the indica group was domesticated origi- 
nally  from  O.  rufipogon,  and,  afterward,  the japonica   was  obtained  from  indica  
(Chang  1976; Lu et al. 2002). Compared to japonica , greater genetic diversity has  
been seen in indica group (Garris et al. 2005). The close genetic association between  
existing populations of both annual and perennial forms of O. rufipogon and indica  
supports  this  hypothesis.  The  second  hypothesis  indicated  that  the japonica   and  
indica separation took place as a result of adaptation to various geographical and  
ecological environments conformity of a single domestication from O. rufipogon. A  
third  hypothesis,  first  proposed  by  Chou  ( 1948),  indicated  that  there  was  at  least  
twice independent rice domestication from a pre-distinction ancestor of O. rufipogon  
gene pool (Kovach et al. 2007). Molecular dating of divergence time demonstrated  
that the genomes of japonica  and  indica had separated 0.2–0.4 million years ago,  
which showed that this divergence time was substantially before the rice domestica- 
tion time. The results of some studies indicate that Himalaya (India, Myanmar, and  
Thailand) is the place of domestication for  indica group and southern China is the  
place of domestication for japonica  rice (Doebley et al.  2006; Londo et al. 2006;  
Sang and Ge 2007). In addition, Molina et al. (2011) pointed out from a single origin  
and several independent domestication models that japonica  and indica were directly  
domesticated from  O. rufipogon (wild rice) and separately from a diverse species  
range of wild rice. Also, Wei et al. (2012) indicated that japonica  and  indica were  
domesticated from distinct populations of O. rufipogon. Recently, Civáň et al. (2015)  
used the footprints of cultivated rice types (genomes) to demonstrate that there were  
three different independent domestications in various parts of Asia. They identified  
wild populations which constitute the japonica  gene pool source in southern Yangtze  
Valley of China, and populations in the Brahmaputra Valley and Indo-China which  
constitute the indica gene pool source. They revealed a hitherto unrecognised origin  
for the aus variety in central India or Bangladesh. They concluded that the result of  
the hybridization between aus and japonica  was aromatic rice and that the temperate  
and tropical japonica  versions were afterwards adaptations of one crop. 
    Previous studies have recognized that O. glaberrima was domesticated from  O.  
barthii in West Africa near the Niger River nearly 3500 years ago (Callaway 2014;  
Wei et al. 2012). O. glaberrima has unique characteristics, such as its strictly annual  
habit, short rounded ligule, few secondary panicle branches, and red pericarp color,  
which differentiate it from Asian rice (Vaughan et al. 2008). 

9.2.2       Domestication Traits  

Because of the considerable variation and introgression by wild rice, some charac- 
ters  are  consistently  distinct  among  domesticated  and  wild  rices.  These  include  
changes  in  size  of  seeds,  shattering,  mating  type,  panicle  architecture,  pericarp  

----------------------- Page 214-----------------------

210                                                                          T.H. Awan et al. 

color, tiller number, number of seeds, and dormancy (Sweeney and McCouch 2007;  
Vaughan et al. 2008). 
   Many phenotypic distinctions are manifested among wild relatives of  O. sativa  
(Li et al. 2006; Sweeney and McCouch 2007; Thomson et al. 2003; Uga et al. 2003).  
Typically, wild rices exhibit long awns, to guarantee the propagation, display, and  
seed dispersal by intense shattering, while short awns and decreased shattering for  
harvesting  the  maximum  number  of  seeds  is  observed  in  domesticated  types  (Ji  
et al. 2006; Kovach et al. 2007; Lin et al. 2007; Vaughan et al. 2008; Yao et al. 2015).  
In addition, Yao et al. (2015), while studying the shattering of seeds in weedy rice,  
detected three quantitative trait loci (QTLs) and demonstrated that the identified  
QTLs (wd-qsh5, wd-qsh3, and wd-qsh1) had no overlaps by main shattering loci  
(e.g., qSH1, SHAT1, SH4, and sh-h). Considering these results, it was suggested  
that genomic studies of domestication traits could be helpful to produce weedy rice  
without the contention of wild type of rice at the agroecosystems. 
   Pericarp of grains from wild rice has a red color because of the pigment in the  
seed coat. Nevertheless, almost all modern rice varieties appear white or beige in the  
absence of red pigmentation. Rc is the only locus that has been indicated to affect  
an alteration of pericarp from red to white. Opposite to its progenitors, the panicle  
shape of rice has altered from an open panicle along scant secondary branches with  
few grains, to an aggregated packed panicle, which can contain more numbers of  
seeds. Therefore, results of domestication studies such as the genes associated and  
the geographic and distribution of alleles will be useful for breeders to better com- 
prehend  ancestors  and  breed  rice  for  future  (Kovach  et  al.  2007;  Sweeney  and  
McCouch 2007). 

9.3      Rice Types and Cultivars in the World 

Rice is included in the family Poaceae and genus Oryza. The plants of this species  
may be annual or perennial and attain a height of 100–200 cm (http://ricepedia.org/ 
rice-as-a-plant). 

9.3.1      Cultivated Rice Species 

9.3.1.1    Oryza sativa 

Important subspecies in Oryza sativa are (1) japonica  (short grained and sticky), (2)  
indica (long grained, the nonsticky rice), and (3) javanica . Japonica varieties are  
usually  cultivated  at  high  elevations  (South Asia),  in  dry  fields  (temperate  East  
Asia), and in upland areas (Southeast Asia). Tropical Asia contains the indica vari- 
eties as most grown rice species. These are mostly sown in submerged and lowland  
conditions. Most probably japonica  and indica were the result of a single domesti- 
cation occurred in China nearly 8000–13,000 years ago.

9   Domestication and Development of Rice Cultivars                                      211 

Japonica 

Japonica rice was originated from China and is grown in Japan. It is usually culti- 
vated  in  temperate  and  cooler  zones  of  the  subtropics.  The  plants  have  a  lower  
height than other types of rice, while its leaves have a dark green color. Low shat- 
tering, hard, short, and rounded grains are some of the characters of japonica  rice.  
Grains are sticky after cooking. 

Javanica or Tropical Japonica 

Javanica or tropical japonica  is another subspecies with an intermediate amylose  
content and stickiness. “Unoy” and “Tinawon” varieties are the examples for this  
rice which are grown in an area in the Philippines. Javanica plants are tall and have  
light green, broad leaves and thick and long grains, which do not shatter easily. Its  
grains are sticky because of the low amylose content. 

Indica 

This is a major type of rice grown in subtropics and tropics of the world. The leaves  
of indica rice are light green in color, and its plants are long in height. Indica and  
japonica  types of rice have glutinous or non-glutinous grains. 

Glutinous  rice:  Desserts  and  snacks  are  made  from  this  rice.  Mostly  grown  in  
    Southeast Asia; this rice is sticky, white, and opaque after cooking. 
Non-glutinous : Non-glutinous rice has lower stickiness than glutinous rice. 
Aromatic  rice ,  including  basmati  from  Pakistan  and  India  and  jasmine  from  
    Thailand: It has 12–13 % share in global trade and earns a premium price in the  
    world markets. 

9.3.1.2     Oryza glaberrima 

The location of domestication for  Oryza glaberrima (African rice) is upper Niger  
River. Its domestication dates back to almost 2000–3000 years, while its wild ances- 
tor (Oryza barthii) can be found in some parts of Africa even nowadays. Grain qual- 
ity and yield of this rice is generally poorer than O. sativa, while it possesses a better  
resistance/tolerance against stresses than O. sativa. 

9.3.2      Grain Characteristics of Cultivated Rice Species 

Cultivated rice species have been classified into following major groups based on  
their grain characteristics.

212                                                                           T.H. Awan et al. 

9.3.2.1     Aromatic Rice Types 

Aromatic rice have medium to long grains. Recent research established that  aromatic  
rices have aroma because of the natural chemicals that give them a distinctive fragrance  
or aroma. In addition to this, they have very low levels of arsenic relative to the nonaro- 
matic rice varieties. Aromatic rices provide fragrance as do the popcorn or roasted nuts.  
Basmati and jasmine are respectively the most important aromatic rices in the world. 
    Aroma is an important trait associated with high-quality grains such as those of  
basmati and jasmine rice. Most of aromatic rice varieties share the same aroma gene,  
badh2. Farmers have rice containing this gene since thousands of years. However,  
what makes rice grains aromatic remains a scientific mystery today. Although 2-ace- 
tyl-1-pyrroline (2AP), the main aromatic compound responsible for the fragrance of  
jasmine and basmati rice varieties, has been identified long ago, more than 150 dif - 
ferent unknown aromatic compounds are now known to exist. Researchers have not  
yet fully understand the contribution of these compounds to aroma. 

Features of Different Types of Aromatic Rice 

Aromatic  rice  includes  basmati,  texmati,  jasmine,  wild  pecan  rice,  and  wehani.  
Grains are light in texture and fluffy after cooking. 

Basmati rice     Basmati is a customar name for certain rice varieties that are exclu- 
sively  grown  in  specific  area  of  Indo  gagnetic  plains.  Basmati  is  slender,  sword  
shaped, long/extra long, and fluffy with high-volume expansion which almost gets  
double on cooking and having typical basmati aroma. Basmati rice is photoperiod  
and thermo sensitive and possesses the following characteristics: 

 Minimum elongation ratio on cooking                            1.7 mm 
 Minimum average pre-cooked grain length                       6.5 mm 
 Amylose content                                               Intermediate (19–26%) 
 Length/breadth ratio                                          More than 3.5 
 Gel consistency                                               Soft 
 Gelatinization temperature                                    Intermediate (69–74 %) 
 Typical basmati aroma                                         Present 
 Grain shape                                                   Slender (sword) 
 Appearance                                                    Translucent 

    Basmati is historically cultivated since centuries in Indian and Pakistani Punjab  
provinces and at the foot of the Himalayan mountain ranges. Both Pakistan and  
India have evolved many basmati rice varieties. Grains of basmati rice are aromatic  
and  long,  and  basmati  means  “queen  of  scents”  or  “pearl  of  scents.” The  word  
basmati  is  derived  from  the  Sanskrit  word  vas,  meaning  “aroma,”  and  mayup,  
meaning “ingrained” or “present from the begining (Singh et al. 2000). Basmati is  
a rice that exudes a sweet, delightful smell when cooked. Basmati rice is a part of  
food culture in many of the European, Arab, and American countries.

Texmati     This is an aromatic rice produced in America. This was developed after a  
cross of basmati rice and long grain (American) rice. 

Wehani rice      This rice type was developed in the USA from basmati, possesses  
long grains and an aroma. 

US black japonica       This rice has a black bran and aroma. 

US Della, Delrose, and Delmont            This rice possesses the characters of both the  
basmati rice and long grain rice and, thus, expresses aroma after it is cooked. 

Red rice    This rice is grown in Bhutan and France (as well as some other parts of  
the world). The grains are reddish brown and possess an aroma. 

Arborio rice     This is a short grain Italian rice and possesses a high starch content.  
This is grown in some states of the USA as well. 

Carnaroli rice     This is arborio rice with larger grains and grown in some regions  
of Italy. 

Jasmine rice      This type of rice is present in China and Thailand, possesses long  
grains, and has fragrance (similar to jasmine). This rice has a good cooking quality  
which resembles to basmati rice; however, jasmine rice is sticky. 

Kalijira rice or Kalo nunia        This rice is grown in Bangladesh and has small non- 
sticky fragrant grains and cooks quickly with a good texture and taste. 

9.3.2.2     Nonaromatic and Non-glutinous Rice 

Glutinous  or  nonaromatic  rice  types  are  usually  neutral  in  flavor  and  are  short  
grained. Some rice types have their value because of their color. This color is usu- 
ally determined by levels of pigment anthocyanin in different layers of the seed  
coat, pericarp, and outer grain layer. 

Black Rice 
This rice is considered to have a high nutritious value being rich in vitamin B and  
containing  many  other  trace  elements  such  as  calcium  and  manganese. Another  
important characteristic of this type is that it can be stored under refrigeration for  
using within 3 months, without spoilage. There are several things which distinguish  
this rice from other rice cultivars, e.g., it is less sticky. It has a sweet flavor, high  
content of iron, minerals, fiber, and vitamins. 

9.3.2.3     Glutinous, Sticky Rice, or Mochi Rice 

Glutinous means sticky, this type of rice has short grains and is glue-like after it is  
cooked. The other names are sweet, botan, waxy, and pearl rice. Glutinous (sticky)  
rice is consumed mainly in dry areas of northern Thailand, Cambodia, and Laos. It

is frequently used for brewing beer and as an important ingredient in snacks and in  
sweet dishes. Laos with 85 % production is the largest producer and consumer of  
glutinous rice. This rice has no dietary gluten but has a high amylopectin and a very  
low amylose. 

9.3.3       Rice Varieties in the World  

The number of rice cultivars being grown in the world exceeds 40,000. International  
Rice Gene Bank in the Philippines keeps the germplasm for nearly 127,000 rice  
cultivars and their wild relatives. This resource is useful for researchers from all rice  
growing regions in the world. 
    Based on grain size and average grain length (AGL), the rice grain may be grouped  
as extra long (>7.5 mm), long (6.6–7.5 mm), medium (5.5–6.6 mm), and short grain  
rice (<5.5 mm). Based on shape {length (L) to width (W) ratio}, rice grain may be  
selender (L-W ratio >3), medium (L-W ratio = 2.1–3), Bold (L-W ratio = 1.1–2), and  
round shape (L-W ratio <1.1). Chalkiness of endosperm, none (0 %), small (<10%),  
medium (11–20 %), and large (>20 %) (Singh et al. 2000). 
    Different types of rice varieties have been developed and named in the following  
countries/regions of the world: 

 No.      Types of varieties                            No.                       Types of varieties

9.4       Conclusions 

Understanding how and when humans domesticated crops from wild progenitors  
might supply more than a retrospective. Learning the dynamics of domestication  
of  a  crop  can  provide  important  lessons  for  the  future.  Currently,  several  QTLs  
detected in rice are being investigated for fine mapping or high- resolution mapping  
studies for genetic dissection. Ultimately, this knowledge will be useful in breeding  
programs as well as improving our knowledge about types of rice cultivated in the  
world with their unique and specific characteristics.

Fertilizer Management in Rice 

Bijay-Singh and V.K. Singh 

10.1       Introduction 

Rice  (Oryza  sativa  L.),  with  global  production  of  more  than  740  M  t  in  2014  
(FAOSTAT 2016), is the staple food for nearly half the world population. Rice can  
be grown both in dry and wet conditions over a wide range of latitudes and across a  
wide range of soil, climatic, and hydrological conditions; primarily, it is grown in  
the humid and subhumid tropics and subtropics. Global average yield of irrigated  
rice is 5 t ha−1, but national, regional, and seasonal yield averages vary widely. In the  
tropics, skilled rice farmers achieve rice yields of 7–8 t ha−1 in the dry season, and  
5–6 t ha−1 in the wet season when cloud cover reduces the amount of solar radiation  

and hence the yield. The productivity of rainfed upland and flood prone deep water  
rice, however, continues to be low and is static around 1.0 t ha−1 (Dobermann and  

Fairhurst  2000). To produce high grain yield levels, modern rice cultivars require  
adequate amount of essential nutrients. Of the total 172.2 Mt fertilizer (N+P O +K O) 2 5   2 
consumed  globally  during  2010–2011,  14.3  %  (24.7  Mt)  was  used  in  rice.  
Percentages for nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) were 15.4, 12.8,  
and  12.6,  respectively  (Heffer  2013).  Intensive  rice  production  and  future  rice  
demands  will  require  knowledge-intensive  strategies  for  the  efficient  use  of  all  
inputs, including fertilizer nutrients. As irrigated and rainfed lowland rice systems  
account for about 80 % of the worldwide harvested rice area and 92 % of total rice  
production (Dobermann and Fairhurst 2000), the discussions in this chapter will be  
focused more toward these production systems.

    In lowland rice ecosystems, the crop is flooded for all or part of the growing sea- 
son. Rice is unique among cereal crops because its root system is adapted to largely  
anaerobic soil conditions. The aquatic environment also alters the availability of sev- 
eral  essential  nutrients,  affects  nutrient  uptake  and  use  efficiency  and  fertilization  
practices. Although some issues still require more research, knowledge of nutrient  
management under flooded soil conditions to produce lowland rice has progressed  
rapidly over the past several decades. Average recovery efficiencies of N, P, and K  
from mineral fertilizers in field trials with rice at 179 farmers’ fields (n = 314) in five  
countries (China, India, Vietnam, Indonesia, and the Philippines) were 33, 24, and  
38  %,  respectively  (Witt  and  Dobermann  2004).  However,  data  compiled  from  
research trials from all over the globe revealed that average recovery efficiency for N  
was calculated as 46 % (Ladha et al. 2005). Better nutrient management practices at  
research stations compared to those followed by farmers was the reason. Similarly,  
optimization of factors that cause low P- and K-use efficiency in rice is important. In  
a long-term experiment with rice in China (Zhang et al. 2006), with no P application  
(NK treatment), rice had a high internal P efficiency of 590 kg grain kg−1, indicating  

P deficiency. Adding P but skipping K (NP treatment) alleviated the P deficiency, but  
because the system was K-deficient, this resulted in suboptimal yield increase and an  
uneconomical  soil  P  accumulation.  With  balanced  fertilization  (NPK),  yield  was  
increased  primarily  due  to  an  increase  in  recovery  and  agronomic  efficiency.  
Imbalanced use of fertilizers not only aggravates the deficiency of K as well as micro- 
nutrients in the soils (Ladha et al. 2003), but also proves to be uneconomic and envi- 
ronmentally unsafe. In about 50 M ha of rice land in Asia, deficiency of phosphorus  
(P), zinc (Zn), or iron (Fe) or excess of salts like iron or aluminum limits rice yields. 
    A large potential exists for increasing rice yield but inefficient nutrient use is one of  
the most limiting factors. To ensure higher rice productivity, appropriate nutrient man- 
agement practices have become an essential component of the modern rice production  
technology. Nutrient use efficiency in rice can be improved by using proper inorganic  
and organic nutrient sources, need-based rate of fertilizer application, appropriate meth- 
ods, and application timing of fertilizers, water management, soil pH management, and  
the use of high yielding cultivars adapted to a given environment. Efficient nutrient  
management in rice has paramount significance for improving yield and profitability in  
short term and better ecological management services in the long-term perspective. 

10.2       Nitrogen 

Nitrogen  is  a  constituent  of  amino  acids,  proteins  (enzymes),  nucleic  acids,  and  
chlorophyll in plants and is usually the most yield limiting nutrient in rice produc- 
tion except in soils containing high organic matter content, which can supply enough  
N during the crop season. It is a mobile element inside the plant so that its deficiency  
symptoms appear first on the older leaves. Lower leaves of N deficient rice plant  
turn yellow later but if the deficiency is not corrected, whole plant may become  
chlorotic. Deficiency of N in rice leads to reduced plant height, tillering, leaf area  
index, and crop photosynthetic rate.

   Irrigated lowland rice is one of the most inefficient crops with respect to fertilizer  
N-use efficiency. Different management options can be followed to supply adequate  
amount of N to rice crop for optimum production and minimal losses into the envi- 
ronment. However, successful adoption of a set of practices for lowland rice requires  
an understanding of the relationships among rice growth and development, the bio- 
logical and chemical transformations of fertilizer and native soil N, soil chemical  
and physical properties, and management of irrigation water. 

10.2.1      Nitrogen      Transformations in Flooded Rice Soils 

Rice is grown in variable, complex, and dynamic soil moisture regimes during a  
crop season. The soil is generally flooded either immediately before rice is seeded  
(as in direct water-seeded culture) or transplanted. In case seedlings are established  
by direct dry-seeded methods as in broadcast or drill-seeded rice, soil is flooded  
when the crop reaches the five-leaf stage and begins to tiller. In typical rice soils  
(heavy  textured  with  low  permeability),  the  flood  water  is  generally  maintained  
until  physiological  maturity.  In  permeable  light  textured  soils,  fields  are  flooded  
every 1 or 2 days after the flood water is drained. In some instances, the flood water  
is intentionally drained to allow the soil to completely dry for specific management  
reasons or it is lost due to lack of short-term water availability. Most of the irrigated  
rice production systems are subjected to alternate wetting and drying (aerobic and  
anaerobic cycles) within the crop season or between the crop seasons. 
   Flooding an oxidized soil affects utilization of both the soil N and the fertilizer N  
by rice. Under aerobic conditions, NH4+ is very rapidly oxidized to NO3−. Flooding  
of the soil accentuates the loss of almost all NO2− and NO3− present in the soil through  

denitrification and leaching (Buresh et al. 2008). Thus, most of N mineralized under  
aerobic soil conditions is lost before its uptake by the rice crop. On the other hand,  
under flooded conditions, organic N continues to be mineralized and remains avail- 
able as NH4+ for plant use rather than being nitrified and lost via denitrification (Fig.  

10.1). To produce optimum rice yields, amount and time of application of fertilizer N  
should be governed by the amount and pattern of organic N mineralized after flood- 
ing. The rice production systems that lack controlled water management and undergo  
several alternate aerobic and anaerobic shifts during a crop season show inefficient N  
use because substantial amounts of applied as well as native soil N are preferentially  
lost via denitrification. The most fundamental N recommendation for lowland rice is  
to use ammonical or NH4+ forming fertilizers such as urea. Ammonium N may be  

lost through volatilization, fixed by clay minerals, or immobilized by soil organic  
matter (Fig. 10.1). The NO3− containing fertilizer sources should not be applied prior  
to soil submergence as NO3−-N may get denitrified or lost via leaching, particularly  

on permeable sandy soils or may possibly be transported in the general direction of  
water movement across a field (Buresh et al. 2008). As NH4+, a cation, attaches to the  

soils cation exchange complex and is held by the soil very close to its point of place- 
ment, NH4+ fixation capacity of a soil should be taken into account when strategies  

for N fertilization are developed to maximize N-use efficiency.

10.2.2       Critical Levels and Uptake of Nitrogen by Rice 

Nitrogen is a highly mobile element inside the plant and when N is deficient in plant  
body it is readily translocated from stems and older leaves to the younger leaves or  
developing panicles at the heading stage. Critical N concentration in the rice plant  
generally increases quadratically with increasing N application rate and decreases  
with an increase in plant age due to the dilution effect (Fageria and Baligar 2001).  
Yoshida ( 1981) found that tiller development was stopped when leaf blade N concen- 
tration was <20 g N kg−1 of plant dry matter; tillering rate was increased linearly as  
leaf blade N concentration increased up to 50 g N kg−1 of plant dry matter. De Datta  
(1981) concluded that 25 g N kg−1 in the leaf blade of rice plants at the active tillering  

stage was the critical value. Because a concentration gradient can be observed among  
the leaf positions from top to bottom, the youngest leaves have a higher N concentra- 
tion than older leaves (Westfall et al. 1973). The N status of the first fully opened leaf  
from the top of rice plants at any given time has been found to be a reliable indicator  
of the N availability in the soil. Technological developments during last decades have  
made it possible to quickly and nondestructively quantify chlorophyll content related  
spectral characteristics of leaves. It can be used to diagnose plant N deficiency and  
efficiently manage fertilizer N in rice (Bijay- Singh 2014). 
    Like most other plants, rice can absorb N from the soil solution both as NO3− and  
NH4+, and the preferential form of N uptake is mainly determined by its abundance

10   Fertilizer Management in Rice                                                                 221 

and accessibility. A large body of published literature, in general, suggests that rice  
prefers  NH4+  compared  to  NO3−;  however,  Takenaga  (1995)  observed  that  rice  
absorbed NH4+-N more effectively during vegetative stage and NO3−-N during repro- 
ductive stage. Rice does not absorb large amounts of NO3− because generally NH4+  

containing fertilizers are applied and management practices largely prevent nitrifica- 
tion (Buresh et al. 2008). Urea undergoes hydrolysis after it is added to soil, and forms  
NH +, hence, both ammonium sulfate [(NH ) SO ] and urea are equally effective N

sources for rice. Ammonium sulfate is a better source of N than urea on alkaline soils  
or when it is not possible to incorporate fertilizer immediately by flooding. Ammonia  
volatilization, i.e., the loss of N as NH  gas, may be a pathway of significant impor-3 
tance when urea is applied to rice in alkaline soils. According to De Datta ( 1981), N  
should be applied as NH4+ at the planting of rice. Once rice crop reaches the panicle  
initiation stage, it rapidly takes up the NO3− form of N. The NH4+ and NO3− forms are  

equally effective when N is used as topdressing to rice (Wilson et al. 1994). 
    Total  N  uptake  and  dry  matter  accumulation  of  rice  with  age  follow  similar  
trends. Adequate  N  availability  during  the  beginning  of  rapid  growth  (tillering)  
plays an important role for optimum growth and yield. With an increase of dry mat- 
ter of rice crop, plant tissue N content decreases due to dilution effect, whereas total  
N uptake increases with increased dry matter. Almost half of the total dry matter is  
produced by the start of panicle initiation/booting stage and accordingly half of the  
total  N  uptake  occurs  by  this  stage.  When  the  supply  of  fertilizer  N  to  rice  is  
 optimum, 50 % of the total N is absorbed before half of the total dry matter is pro- 
duced. Remaining 30–50 % of the total N uptake occurs after the start of panicle  
initiation. About 60–70 % of the above-ground N is located in rice panicle at matu- 
rity. Most of the N in rice grain at harvest is absorbed between rice panicle emer- 
gence and heading. It is initially stored in plant tissue and eventually translocated to  
the panicle. Modern high yielding varieties producing around 5 t ha−1 of grain, in  

general, can remove about 110 kg N from the soil. Uptake of native soil N plays a  
crucial role in the N nutrition of rice crop. The total N content of rice straw and grain  
at maturity usually contains 20–40 % more N than that supplied by fertilizer and  
this extra (other than fertilizer) N is supplied by native soil N (Moore et al.  1981). 

10.2.3       Nitrogen       Use Efficiency and Fertilizer N Management  
             in Rice 

Fertilizer N is used efficiently when a large proportion of the applied fertilizer is  
taken  up  by  the  crop  (termed  recovery  efficiency),  and  there  is  a  reasonable  
increase  in  yield  for  each  kilogram  of  fertilizer  N  applied  (termed  agronomic  
efficiency). In the case of rice, N fertilizer use efficiency varies widely depending  
upon  the  fertilizer  source,  the  N  application  time,  or  both.  The  recovery  effi- 
ciency of N fertilizer by rice generally ranges from 20 to 80 % (Fageria et al.  
2003) with an average of about 30–40 % (Cassman et al.  1993). However, the  
amount of N not accounted for N recovery efficiency should not be interpreted as  
N  that  is  lost  without  utilization  from  the  soil–plant  system. A  portion  of  the  

----------------------- Page 226-----------------------

222                                                               Bijay-Singh and V.K. Singh 

unaccounted N may certainly be lost by denitrification, leaching, and ammonia  
volatilization, but a significant portion of this N may be incorporated into the  
microbial biomass or reside in the rice root system and become a part of the soil  
organic matter. Between 16 and 25 % of the total applied N fertilizer has been  
recovered in the soil organic fraction between panicle differentiation and matu- 
rity of rice (Bollich et al.  1994). 
   The rate, source, time of application, and method or placement of N fertilizer  
determine N recovery efficiency in the above-ground biomass of lowland rice. Many  
of the principles that govern N-use efficiency are the same for transplanted, dry direct  
seeded, or direct-water-seeded rice cultures (Fageria et al. 2003). The time of appli- 
cation of split doses of fertilizer N varies because critical growth stages of rice under  
different systems occur at different times. Nitrogen fertilizer is typically applied in at  
least two or more split doses in most of the rice production systems. The first applica- 
tion is often termed as basal dose. Sometimes the basal application represents the  
largest portion (50–75 % of the total N requirement) of N fertilizer applied in any  
single application during the growing season. In transplanted rice systems, N fertil- 
izer is applied to the soil surface and mechanically incorporated before the field is  
flooded, applied to the soil surface and incorporated by the flood water, or injected  
into the soil. In the dry seeded, delayed flood system, the basal dose of N is applied  
during early vegetative growth and followed by  application of irrigation. Regardless  
of the cultural system, the most fundamental components of basal N management are  
the use of an ammonium-forming N fertilizer source, the N fertilizer application on  
a dry soil surface, and the immediate flooding of the soil (Kamprath and Watson  
1980). Split doses of fertilizer N applied as top dressings after the basal dose are  
utilized more efficiently than basal application (Westcott et al.  1986). Recovery effi- 
ciency of top dressed N doses is, however, determined by rice growth stage and time  
of application. Due to low rates of fertilizer N (around one-third of the total fertilizer  
N), a highly developed rice root system, and the high plant N requirement around  
panicle initiation stage, recovery efficiency of top dressed N dose is very high and  
may range between 45 (Westcott et al.  1986) and 82 % (Wilson et al. 1994). 
   Proper management of the floodwater is critical for efficient utilization of N fer- 
tilizer applied to rice. If flood water is drained before uptake of N by rice, nitrifica- 
tion  of  NH4+-N  may  lead  to  production  of  NO3−-N,  which  may  get  leached  or  

denitrified in case soil is reflooded. The recovery efficiency of the basal application  
of urea-N in the dry-seeded, delayed flood system may approach to 70 % under  
optimum conditions (Wilson et al.  1994). When basal N is applied to a wet soil or  
the flood water is mismanaged, the recovery efficiency declines. In several regions  
in the Indo-Gangetic plains in South Asia, generally continuous flooding of rice  
cannot be maintained either due to shortage of water or due to high water percola- 
tion rates in the soil and it leads to alternating flooded (reduced or anaerobic) and  
drained (oxidized or aerobic) conditions. Therefore, nitrification occurs during “dry  
spells” and nitrates thus produced are subsequently reduced to N  and N O through 2 2 
denitrification when soils are reflooded. Although there is much variation in the data  
on nitrification rates estimated at different locations in the Indo-Gangetic plain, a  
trend  with  respect  to  soil  temperature  and  pH  is  easily  discernible  (Aulakh  and  
Bijay-Singh  1997).

10   Fertilizer Management in Rice                                                        223 

   A lot of research on N fertilization of rice in different regions has focused on  
developing management practices for the production of high yields while minimiz- 
ing N losses and costs associated with N fertilization. Optimum fertilizer N rates,  
improved methods, and timings of application and placement, use of specially for- 
mulated forms of fertilizer including those with urease and nitrification inhibitors,  
integrated use of fertilizer, manures, and/or crop residues have been standardized  
to achieve better synchronization between the supply and requirement of N by rice.  
Nevertheless, best management practices for fertilizer N in rice do not simply con- 
sist of a universal set of recommendations. These are designed to achieve the four  
main objectives of cropping systems management: productivity, profitability, sus- 
tainability, and environmental health. The phrase “right source at the right rate,  
right time, and right place” implies that each fertilizer N management practice is  
right in terms of the goals of sustainable production. A balance among the four  
“rights” is essential as it helps to avoid too much emphasis on one at the expense  
of overlooking the others. Fertilizer N rate may sometimes be overemphasized,  
owing  to  its  direct  relation  to  cost.  Source,  time,  and  method  of  placement  are  
sometimes  overlooked.  For  example,  urea  super  granules  (1  g  size  granules  of  
urea) were developed for easy application of urea in the reduced zone of puddled  
rice soils and for minimizing N loss through NH  volatilization (Savant et al. 1982). 3 
This combination of source modification and method of placement is very success- 
ful and becoming popular with farmers, particularly in Bangladesh (Bowen et al.  
2005). However, Bijay-Singh and Katyal ( 1987) revealed that urea super granules  
applied in the reduced zone of coarse textured soils prove to be very inefficient  
source of N for rice. In highly permeable soils, N applied as urea super granules  
was readily leached as urea beyond root zone of rice (Katyal et al.  1985). The four  
aspects  of  fertilizer  N  management,  i.e.,  source,  rate,  time,  and  place  are  com- 
pletely interconnected and are also linked to the full set of management practices  
for the cropping system. None of the four can be right when any one of them is  
wrong.  For  a  given  situation,  there  can  be  more  than  one  right  combination  of  
source, rate, timing, or placement, but when one of the four changes, the others  
may also change. Some general guidelines for efficient N management in rice are  
listed in Table  10.1. 
   In a majority of the rice-growing regions in Asia and in the developing countries,  
blanket recommendations for N management are practiced. These consist of fixed  
rates and timing for large tracts having similar climate and land forms, and cannot  
help to increase N-use efficiency beyond a limit. Due to large field-to-field variabil- 
ity of soil N supply, efficient use of N fertilizer is not possible when broad-based  
blanket recommendations for N fertilizer are used (Adhikari et al.  1999). Optimum  
crop  yields  can  be  obtained  with  the  fixed-rate  method  provided  the  nutrient  
 application level is high enough to compensate for a possible low supply of the  
nutrient from the soil in any field in the region. Obviously, a wide range in blanket  
recommendations for N fertilizer application rates is expected for different  countries  
(Table 10.2) and within each country. Advantages of the fixed nutrient rate method  
are its simplicity and no costs involved for soil analysis. The uniform adoption of  
blanket recommendations does not ensure economy and efficiency of N fertilizer  
use since the variation in soil fertility is not taken into account, and there will be

wastage of fertilizers in some fields. As efficient N use is central to eco-efficiency in  
agriculture, it is important to work out N fertilizer doses that will produce not only  
high yields of rice per unit area and remain economically attractive to farmers but  
also result in minimal environmental impacts.

10   Fertilizer Management in Rice                                                         225 

   Farmers in many developing countries in Asia have developed a tendency to  
rely primarily on N fertilizers to maximize rice yields. High levels of N fertilizer  
without appropriate balance with P and K result in negative effects on rice yields,  
the soil, and the environment in addition to increased incidence of crop lodging,  
weed  competition,  and  pest  attacks. As  intensive  cereal  systems  remove  large  
quantities of N, P, and K, an imbalanced application of nutrients leads to mining  
from the soil for the nutrients that are not supplied in adequate amounts, or yield  
levels are determined by the amount of nutrient supplied in the least amount. In a  
long-term experiment on rice–wheat cropping system in India, Kumar and Yadav  
(2001) found that 20 years after continuously applying different combinations of  
N, P, and K rates to both the crops, the highest rate of yield decline in rice and  
wheat was found when 120 kg ha−1 N was applied with no P and K. The lowest  

rate  of  decline  was  observed  when  N,  P,  and  K  were  applied  at  40,  35,  and  
33 kg ha−1, respectively. 

10.2.3.1     Controlled-N Release Fertilizers 

Many times low N-use efficiency in rice is observed due to lack of synchronization  
between  crop  demand  and  release  of  N  from  water-soluble  sources  like  urea.  
Application of soluble N fertilizers to rice in split doses is an attempt to increase the  
degree of synchronization between supply and demand of N, but there is a limit to  
achieve it. In recent decades, controlled-release N fertilizers have been developed  
that consist of highly soluble urea prills or granules coated with water- insoluble  
materials like sulfur or polyolefin that control the rate, pattern, and duration of N  
release (Shaviv  2001). Besides the advantages of controlled-released fertilizers in  
reducing N losses to the environment and increasing fertilizer N-use efficiency in  
rice (Chalk et al. 2015; Pandey and Singh 1987; Patil et al. 2010; Wang et al. 2015;  
Yan et al. 2008; Ye et al. 2013), the rate of N application and the number of applica- 
tions during the growing season can often be reduced, which has the added advan- 
tage  of  saving  labor  costs.  In  recent  years,  different  variants  of  polymer- coated  
controlled-release urea have been designed to synchronize N release and crop N  
uptake with minimal leakage of N to the environment. These have already been  
tested for obtaining high yields of rice along with high N-use efficiency (Kondo  
et al. 2005; Patil et al. 2010; Singh et al. 2007; Wang et al. 2015; Yan et al. 2008; Ye  
et al. 2013; Zhang et al. 2012). 

10.2.3.2     Urease and Nitrification Inhibitors 

In  flooded  rice  systems,  NH4+-N  originating  from  hydrolyzed  urea  accumulates  in  

floodwater and is prone to NH  volatilization due to elevated pH of flood water during 3 
daylight hours and increased temperatures. Even when urea is applied during non- 
flooded periods, applied N can be lost via NH  volatilization in substantial amounts. In 3 
flooded rice systems, N losses via NH  volatilization have been recorded in the range 3 

----------------------- Page 230-----------------------

226                                                                  Bijay-Singh and V.K. Singh 

of 20–56 % of applied N (De Datta et al. 1989; Fillery and De Datta 1986). The use of  
urease inhibitors to reduce NH  volatilization from urea hydrolysis has emerged as an 3 
effective strategy to increase N-use efficiency of urea-based N products in rice. Urease  
inhibitor  NBPT  [N-(n-butyl)  thiophosphorictriamide]  has  been  reported  to  signifi- 
cantly reduce NH  volatilization losses due to urea application to rice (Buresh et al. 3 
1988; Norman et al. 2009). Besides use of hydroquinone in China, NBPT is the only  
urease inhibitor of commercial and practical importance in agriculture (Trenkel 2010).  
Several researchers have recorded significant increase in grain yield of rice due to com- 
bined application of NBPT + urea over application of urea alone (Dillon et al. 2012;  
Liu et al. 2014; Norman et al. 2009; Pang and Peng 2010; Rogers et al. 2015). In China,  
hydroquinone is being extensively used as a urease inhibitor in rice because of its lower  
price (Yeomans and Bremner  1986). Malla et al. (2005) and Xu et al. (2005) observed  
that urea amended with hydroquinone can improve crop growth of rice. 
    Losses via nitrification–denitrification in rice soils can be substantial when an  
aerobic period is followed by an anaerobic period. Such conditions in rice systems  
are encountered in a drying and wetting cycle as in permeable soils or in intermittent  
wet  and  dry  rice  systems  (Belder  et  al.  2004).  In  flooded  rice  fields,  there  exist  
adjoining aerobic zones where nitrification can occur and anaerobic zones where  
denitrification occurs (Fig. 10.1). The transport of NO3− between aerobic and anaer- 

obic zones couples nitrification with denitrification (Buresh et al. 2008). Losses via  
denitrification have been recorded in the range of 12–33 % (Aulakh et al.  2001;  
Buresh et al.  1993). Nitrification inhibitors are chemicals that when added to N fer- 
tilizers and applied to soil, delay the transformation of NH4+ to NO2− by inhibiting  

or at least by slowing the action of Nitrosomonas spp. bacteria. Many compounds  
that can inhibit nitrification have been identified (Trenkel 2010), but three products  
are available on commercial scale. These are: (i) 2-chloro-6-(trichloromethyl) pyri- 
dine (Nitrapyrin) with the trade name “N Serve”, (ii) dicyandiamide (DCD, H C N ), 4        2 4 
and (iii) 3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP). In a meta-analysis based on 10  
studies in which urea was the N source, Linquist et al. (2013) observed that applica- 
tion of DCD resulted in 16.5 % overall increase in yield of rice. Norman et al. ( 1989)  
and Wilson et al. (1990) used  15N-labeled fertilizers and observed N uptake effi- 

ciency in rice by applying DCD along with urea. It has been observed that DCD in  
combination with hydroquinone could substantially reduce N O emissions during 2 
rice growth season (Xu et al. 2000, 2002). Li et al. (2009) found that application of  
DMPP nitrification inhibitor with urea increased the rice grain yield by 6–18 %. In  
India, oil extracted from the seeds of neem (Azadirachta indica A. Juss) is used as  
nitrification inhibitor; all urea sold in the country is now treated with neem oil. 

10.2.4       Site-Specific Nitrogen Management in Rice 

Among many factors that influence N-use efficiency, one potentially important fac- 
tor is the uncertainty faced by farmers in deciding the amount of N fertilizer to be  
applied (Lobell 2007). This uncertainty can be reduced by knowing the N supplying

capacity of the soil. Applying quantity of fertilizer N calculated by considering soil  
N supply rather than following traditional farming practices resulted in an increase  
in N-use efficiency by 30–40 % and grain yield by 7 % in 179 irrigated rice fields in  
Asia (Dobermann et al. 2002). Another reason for low N-use efficiency is the inef- 
ficient splitting of N applications and use of excess N than the required. In addition  
to  field-to-field  variability,  the  strategies  for  N  fertilizer  management  must  be  
responsive to temporal variations in crop N demand to achieve supply–demand syn- 
chrony and minimize N losses. Cassman et al. (2002) found that N recovery by  
irrigated rice at on-farm locations in Asia averaged 31 % compared to 40 % for rice  
grown under field-specific management. Peng and Cassman (1998) demonstrated  
that recovery efficiency of top-dressed urea during panicle initiation stage could be  
as high as 78 %. Thus, improvement in the synchrony between crop-N demand and  
N supply from soil and/or the applied N fertilizer is likely to be the most promising  
strategy to increase N-use efficiency in rice. 
   Number of split doses, the amount of N applied per split, and the time of applica- 
tion vary considerably even within small recommendation domains. However, on the  
positive side, flexibility of the farmers in adjusting the timing and amount of fertilizer  
N applied offers great potential to synchronize the site-specific N application with  
the demand of the rice in real time. It was in mid-1980s and 1990s that the emphasis  
was shifted from reducing N losses to feeding needs of rice crop for increasing N-use  
efficiency (Buresh 2007). The research was oriented toward finding means and ways  
to apply N in real-time using crop and site-specific needs. Methods based on soil  
tests and analysis of tissue samples did not work because these were time consuming,  
cumbersome, and expensive. Also, N prescriptions based on soil tests done before  
planting of rice cannot account for variations in the weather during the rice season.  
Because rice farmers often use leaf color as a visual and subjective indicator of the  
need for N fertilizer in rice, the breakthrough in the diagnostic tools that can assess  
N need of crop plants in real time came from spectral characteristics of rice leaves.  
Chlorophyll  content  and/or  biomass  of  rice  leaves  can  be  estimated  through  the  
development of some noninvasive optical methods based on leaf greenness, absor- 
bance, and/or reflectance of light by the intact leaf. These include chlorophyll meters,  
leaf color charts (LCC), optical sensors, ground-based remote sensors, and digital,  
aerial, and satellite imageries. Over more than a decade, chlorophyll meter, LCC, and  
Green Seeker optical sensor have been extensively tried to improve N-use efficiency  
in rice grown in different agroecosystems and regions. 
   Hand-held chlorophyll meters provide a fast, easy, on-site, precise, and scientific  
way to appraise the N needs of rice. The chlorophyll meter quantifies green color of  
the leaf by measuring the relative quantity of chlorophyll. Most of the research directly  
evaluating the effectiveness of chlorophyll meters in improving N-use efficiency has  
been conducted with the rice crop across different regions in Asia. In the majority of  
the transplanted or direct-seeded rice farms across Vietnam (Son et al. 2004), China  
(Wang et al. 2001), Indonesia (Abdulrachman et al. 2004), Philippines (Gines et al.  
2004), Thailand (Satawathananont et al. 2004), and India (Bijay-Singh et al. 2002;  
Khurana 2005; Maiti et al. 2004), chlorophyll meter-based N management led to sig- 
nificant  increases  in  N-use  efficiency  when  compared  with  the  farmers’  fertilizer

practices. At some places, increase in N-use efficiency was moderate thereby suggest- 
ing the need to integrate chlorophyll meter with other site-specific factors to make it  
a more effective in N management tool. To use chlorophyll meter, there is a need to  
determine a critical value that is unique to an environment and below which N-use  
efficiency and/or crop yields are likely to be adversely affected. Critical chlorophyll  
meter  values  can  be  fixed  for  different  regions  or  varietal  groups  or  these  can  be  
dynamic.  The  dynamic  threshold  chlorophyll  value  or  sufficiency  index  approach  
ensures maintaining intensity of the color of leaves at 90 % or more of the intensity in  
the overfertilized reference plot (Bijay-Singh et al. 2006; Hussain et al. 2000). It has  
the advantage of being self-calibrating for different soils, seasons, and cultivars. In  
different  regions  across  the Asia,  critical  chlorophyll  meter  values  for  rice  ranged  
between 32 and 37.5. A difference of even 2 units in these critical values can decrease  
N-use efficiency and/or reduce yields as evidenced in some of these studies. In Texas,  
Turner and Jund ( 1994) reported the need for N in rice when chlorophyll meter values  
of the most recently matured leaves are less than the critical value of 40. 
    Leaf color chart consists of a panel of green plastic chips ranging with colors  
based on the wavelength characteristics of leaves and ranging from yellowish green  
to dark green that, respectively, cover a continuum from leaf N deficiency to exces- 
sive leaf N content (Pasuquin et al. 2004). Thus, unlike chlorophyll meter that mea- 
sures light absorption, LCCs measure leaf greenness and the associated leaf N by  
visually comparing light reflection from the surface of leaves and the LCC (Yang  
et al. 2003). These are simple, easy-to-use, and inexpensive alternatives to chloro- 
phyll meters and are particularly beneficial for individual income-poor farmers in  
Asian countries (Bijay-Singh et al.  2002). There are two major approaches in the  
use of the LCC (Fairhurst et al. 2007; Witt et al. 2005). In the real-time approach, a  
prescribed amount of fertilizer N is applied whenever the color of rice leaves falls  
below a critical LCC value. The fixed splitting pattern  approach provides a recom- 
mendation for the total N fertilizer requirement (kg ha−1) and a plan for splitting and  

timing of applications in accordance with crop growth stage, cropping season, vari- 
ety used, and crop establishment method. The LCC is used at critical growth stages  
to decide whether the recommended standard N rate will be needed to adjust up or  
down based on leaf color (Bijay-Singh et al. 2012; Fairhurst et al. 2007). Leaf color  
chart-based  N  management  has  been  evaluated  mostly  following  the  “real-time”  
approach rather than “fixed time adjustable dose” method. We have listed (Table  
10.3) two categories of comparisons between LCC method and farmers’ fertilizer  
practice (FFP) for managing fertilizer N in rice in Asia. In the first category, the  
most commonly observed effect of following LCC-based N management is the pro- 
duction of rice yield similar to that with FFP but with less N fertilizer application. It  
suggests that farmer’s N management practice is inadequate. In another scenario, an  
increase in grain yield with a reduction in N fertilizer use was observed by follow- 
ing LCC method (Table 10.3). Increase in partial factor productivity (PFP) in all the  
comparisons listed in Table  10.3 may also occur due to retention of increasing pro- 
portion of N inputs in soil organic and inorganic N pools. Adoption of LCC method  
for managing N by farmers is likely to be driven by economic returns. With small-

10   Fertilizer Management in Rice                                                         231 

to- medium farm size in developing countries, the use of a simple and inexpensive  
leaf color chart is assisting farmers in applying N when the plant needs it. 
    Several  researchers  have  used  mid-season  spectral  reflectance  measurements  
with optical/crop canopy sensors to estimate rice growth and N status (Ali et al.  
2014; Bajwa et al. 2010; Nguyen et al. 2006; Xue et al. 2004). Based on target yield  
approach and split fertilization approach, Xue et al. (2014) used Green Seeker opti- 
cal sensor for top-dressing N at panicle initiation stage of rice. Tubaña et al. (2011)  
also used canopy reflectance to top-dress N fertilizer at panicle initiation stage of  
rice. Recently, Bijay-Singh et al. (2015) found that high N-use efficiency and opti- 
mum yield of transplanted rice can be achieved by applying a moderate amount of  
N fertilizer at transplanting, enough N fertilizer at active tillering, and an optical  
sensor-guided N fertilizer dose at panicle initiation stage of rice. 
    Site-specific nitrogen management for rice as developed in Asia by International  
Rice Research Institute (IRRI) and described by Witt et al. (2007) advocates estima- 
tion of N fertilizer requirement of rice from the difference between a yield target  
and the yield without N fertilizer. The N-limited yield can be determined with the  
nutrient omission plot technique (IRRI (International Rice Research Institute) 2007)  
as the grain yield of a crop not fertilized with N but supplied with enough quantity  
of other nutrients. As only a fraction of the N fertilizer applied to rice is taken up by  
the crop, total amount of N fertilizer required for each ton of increase in grain yield  
is estimated by using agronomic efficiency factor; an efficiency of N use of 18–20  
should be achievable by good crop management in tropical Asia. To ensure that sup- 
ply of N matches the crop need at critical growth stages, the estimated total fertilizer  
N requirement by rice crop is then apportioned among multiple times of application  
during  the  growing  season.  The  site-specific  nitrogen  management  approach  as  
developed by IRRI advocates the use of LCC for monitoring the relative greenness  
of a rice leaf as an indicator of the leaf N status (Witt et al.  2005) and guide the  
application of N fertilizer doses to rice at appropriate stages. 

10.2.5      Nitrogen     Management for  Rice Hybrids 

An ideal rice genotype is able to absorb a relatively large quantity of N from soil and  
is capable of producing a high grain yield per unit of absorbed N besides storing  
relatively a small amount of N in straw. Different lowland rice genotypes vary sig- 
nificantly with respect to N-use efficiency and the differences may be related to  
many  physiological  processes  such  as  absorption,  nitrate  reduction  efficiency,  N  
remobilization, translocation, assimilation, and storage (Isfan  1993). Nitrogen har- 
vest index is a measure of N portioning in rice among genotypes; high N harvest  
index is associated with efficient utilization of N (Rattunde and Frey  1986). Rice  
hybrids have 10–15 % yield advantage over conventional rice cultivars (Yang and  
Sun 1988) and it is presumably related to a greater total N uptake and internal N-use  
efficiency. Yang ( 1987) reported that total N uptake by hybrid rice was greater than  
that  of  conventional  rice  cultivars,  especially  from  transplanting  to  tillering  and

from panicle emergence to grain filling stages. Hybrid rice takes about 15–20 % of  
its total N uptake after heading and provide consistently higher response to N fertil- 
izer application at flowering compared to only 6–7 % for the conventional cultivars.  
Therefore, hybrid rice has greater agronomic efficiency compared to conventional  
rice (Lin and Yuan  1980). The primary factors contributing to the high N-use effi- 
ciency in hybrid rice are high N recovery efficiency, more root N absorption poten- 
tial, high shoot N-use capacity, and high N remobilization efficiency. 

10.3      Phosphorus 

Phosphorus is one of the major essential nutrients for plants. It is a component of  
high energy compounds like adenosine triphosphate and genetic materials required  
for seed production. It is also involved in the synthesis of compounds like phospho- 
lipids,  nucleotides,  glycophosphates  and  its  deficiency  can  dramatically  reduce  
growth and yield of plants. In rice, deficiency of P appears when tillering starts and  
plant begins to accumulate dry matter. Symptoms include severe stunting and erect  
leaves with dark green color. Deficiency of P retards cell elongation and leaf expan- 
sion (Marschner 1995). Fageria (1980) observed a delay by as much as 10–12 days  
in rice maturity due to P deficiency. Application of P to rice on P-deficient soils  
increased rice root growth, number of panicles and grain weight of rice (Fageria and  
Gheyi  1999). Under P deficient conditions, rice does not respond to application of  
N, K, and other nutrients. 
   Phosphorus nutrition of rice crop depends upon the ability of a soil to supply P  
to plant roots and desorption characteristics of the soil (Roy and De Datta  1985).  
Concentration of inorganic P in the soil solution and the capacity of the soil to main- 
tain this concentration determine the supply of P to rice roots. Plants rarely absorb  
more than 20 % of the total fertilizer P applied (Friesen et al.  1997). Reduced soil  
conditions under lowland rice normally increase the P availability to rice, and in  
many soils, P availability is not a yield-limiting factor for rice. However, on the  
same soil, upland crops like wheat and maize might show dramatic responses to P  
fertilization. Both P sorption capacity of the soil and bonding energy of P increase  
under alternate anaerobic–aerobic conditions (Sanyal and De Datta  1991). On the  
other  hand,  flooding  decreases  the  crystallinity  of  ferrous  hydroxides,  which  
increases their sorption capacity, increases the insoluble Fe–P fraction, and reduces  
P desorption. 

10.3.1      Critical P Level in Plant and Uptake of P by Rice 

Phosphorus is a mobile element inside the plant. Therefore, P concentration of indi- 
vidual leaf decreases with advancement of leaf age. Top leaves have the highest P  
concentration  and  the  bottom  leaves  have  the  lowest  P  concentration,  especially

when available P in the soil is limited. During early vegetative growth, P concentra- 
tion in rice tissue increases with increasing P rates. Tissue P concentration remains  
nearly constant from panicle initiation until flowering. After flowering, the filling of  
rice grain starts and becomes a strong sink for P and straw P concentration declines. 
   Critical tissue P concentrations for rice during vegetative growth range from 1.0  
to 2.0 g P kg−1. According to Yoshida (1981), 2.0 g P kg−1 in the first fully opened  

leaf from the top was needed to realize the maximum tillering rate. De Datta ( 1981)  
suggested that 1.0 g P kg−1 in the rice leaf blades at active tillering was the critical  

concentration. In general, whole plant P concentrations during vegetative growth at  
>2.0 g P kg−1 are sufficient for optimum rice growth and yield production. 

   The above-ground P uptake by high-yielding rice varieties may approach 60 kg  
P ha−1, but more commonly it ranges from 25 to 50 kg P ha−1 with 60–75 % of the  

total plant P contained in the panicles at maturity (Fageria et al. 2003). Seasonal P  
uptake and dry matter accumulation tend to follow similar patterns and accumula- 
tion of P is closely related to plant age. The average P harvest index [Grain P/(Grain  
P + Straw P)] generally ranges from 0.60 to 0.75. The rice grains remove a signifi- 
cantly large proportion of total P uptake during the crop growth period. Therefore,  
recycling of rice straw to the field cannot contribute much P for succeeding crop in  
the rotation. 

10.3.2      Phosphorus        Management Strategies in Rice 

Phosphorus management in rice aims at preventing P deficiency rather than treat- 
ing P-deficiency symptoms. Significant response of modern rice varieties to P fer- 
tilizer may be observed after several years of intensive cropping, particularly when  
both N and K were applied or when the P-supplying capacity of the soil is low   
(De Datta et al.  1988). Therefore, P management must focus on the buildup and  
maintenance of adequate available P levels in the soil to ensure that P supply does  
not limit crop growth and N-use efficiency (Fairhurst et al. 2007). Inputs of P from  
sources such as irrigation water and straw are small but P is not easily lost from the  
system. As P fertilizer applications exhibit residual effects that can last several  
years maintenance of soil P supply requires long-term strategies tailored to site- 
specific conditions that consider P inputs from all sources (Fairhurst et al. 2007).  
Unbalanced P input/output can lead to either depletion or excessive enrichment of  
soil  P  in  intensive  irrigated  rice  systems.  For  example,  in  a  survey  of  farmers’  
fields carried out by Oberthuer et al. ( 1995), 64 % of a 20,000-ha area of irrigated  
rice in Central Luzon, Philippines, was classified as low in available soil P reserves.  
In contrast, 85 % of the total lowland rice area in Java, Indonesia, was found to be  
having  high  soil  P  status  and  rice  yields  no  longer  responded  to  applied  P   
(Sri Adiningsih et al. 1991). 
   Use of calibrated soil test values is still the best criteria for making P fertilizer  
recommendations for rice, although routine soil test methods may not provide a reli- 
able estimate of the P available to lowland rice. For example, soils used for growing

lowland rice commonly have low soil test P values but may or may not respond to P  
fertilization (Shahandeh et al.  1994; Wilson et al. 1999). Different extractants tend  
to under- or overestimate P availability even to upland crops (Kamprath and Watson  
1980).  Their  ability  to  accurately  predict  the  P  fertilizer  requirement  of  flood-  
irrigated rice is further compromised by the anaerobic soil conditions used for pro- 
duction of rice. Although no single extractant has shown a significant advantage for  
making P recommendations on lowland rice, Sanyal and De Datta ( 1991) suggested  
that Olsen P is perhaps the best routine method for predicting rice response to P as  
it is better correlated with the extraction of Fe–P. 
    Classical empirical approach for making P recommendations based on critical  
soil  test  levels  and  P  fertilizer  response  curves  requires  a  large  number  of  site-  
specific field calibration studies. It does not take into account crop P requirements  
based on a target yield and interactions with other nutrients. Another approach to  
work out P recommendations for rice is based on estimates of the potential soil P  
supply and crop P uptake (Fageria and Gheyi 1999). Potential P supply can be esti- 
mated as P uptake by a rice crop from indigenous soil resources measured under  
field conditions, when all other nutrients are amply supplied (Janssen et al.  1990).  
Fairhurst et al. (2007) have described a practical version of using this strategy for  
calculating  P  rates  for  lowland  rice.  Blanket  recommendations  for  large  regions  
(Table  10.2) are still widely used for applying P to rice in many developing coun- 
tries in Asia because currently available soil P maps do not provide a satisfactory  
basis   for   specifying   soil   type-specific   fertilizer   recommendations.   In   fact,  
management- induced  variation  between  farmers  is  much  larger  than  differences  
among soil types. 
    Sustainable P management requires the replenishment of soil P reserves, espe- 
cially at high yield levels in double and triple rice-cropping systems, even if a direct  
yield response to P application is not expected. According to Fairhurst et al. (2007),  
the rule of thumb is: where the soil P supply is small, apply 8.7 kg P ha−1 for each  

tonne of target grain yield increase (difference between yield target and yield in  
no-P plot). According to Dobermann et al. (2000), 26 kg P ha−1 is normally applied  

to obtain maximum yield of flooded rice in Asia. To produce maximum rice yields,  
recommendation for P fertilizer in the United States ranges between 10 and 40 kg P  
ha−1 (Norman et al. 2003). Soils with high P fixing capacities may require as high as  
97–175  kg  P  ha−1  (Chen  1997)  to  produce  optimum  yields.  Using  appropriate  

method of P application is critical to reduce the P input and increase P fertilizer use  
efficiency. For example, high P rates cited by Fageria ( 1980) for high P fixing in  
Brazilian acidic lowland soils were reduced from 97–175 to 22–44 kg P ha−1 if the  

fertilizer  was  banded  rather  than  broadcast.  Phosphorus  fertilizer  is  generally  
applied to rice at planting, but late application can be made provided it is not later  
than the time of active tillering (De Datta  1981). Early application of P is essential  
for root elongation. According to Patrick et al. ( 1974), broadcast preplant incorpo- 
rated P application is equally effective as P drilled with the seed. However, due to  
rapid fixation of P in alkaline soils, McGee et al. (2002) observed that broadcast  
application of P at the five-leaf stage increased tissue P concentration, P uptake, and  
grain yield more than P broadcast applied to the soil surface at seeding. When P is

deficient, rice yield response to P fertilizer declines as the time of P fertilization is  
delayed (Patrick et al.  1974; Slaton et al. 1998). Patrick et al. (1974) showed that P  
placed  with  the  rice  seed  during  drilling  was  superior  to  broadcast  application  
2 weeks after seeding. Dipping rice seedlings into P slurry before transplanting has  
also been reported to be useful (De Datta 1981). Most commonly used fertilizers to  
supply P to rice are the highly water-soluble single and triple-super phosphates,  
diammonium phosphate, and sometimes monoammonium phosphate. There is no  
evidence of differences in rice responses to different sources of water-soluble P. 
    When lowland rice is grown in rotation with an upland crop like wheat (as in the  
vast Indo-Gangetic plains in South Asia), P is managed in cropping system rather  
than in individual crops. General recommendation is that P should be applied to  
wheat and rice can use the residual P from the soil (Meelu et al.  1982; Palmer et al.  
1990;  Run-Kun  et  al.  1982).  The  availability  of  soil  P  and  residual  fertilizer  P  
increases under submergence and high temperatures prevailing during rice growth.  
Also, rice has a greater ability to utilize the residual P from Fe–P and Al–P fractions  
than wheat (Gill and Meelu  1983). For the rice–wheat system, when 26 kg P ha−1  

was applied to wheat, rice did not respond to P (Table 10.4). However, from a 7-year  
study, Yadvinder-Singh et al. (2000) suggested that P should also be applied to rice  
at rates of >15 kg P ha−1 if rice yields greater than 6 t ha−1 are targeted. Similar  

conclusions could be drawn from a 4-year study on a clay loam soil (Faroda  1992)  
(Table 10.4). 

10.4       Potassium 

Potassium is a major plant nutrient that improves root growth and plant vigor, helps  
prevent lodging, and enhances crop resistance to pests and diseases. It is often the  
most limiting nutrient after N in high yielding rice systems. It plays an important  
role in lignification of vascular bundles, a factor that contributes to susceptibility to  
lodging and diseases in K-deficient plants. The deficient symptoms of K in rice can

236                                                                  Bijay-Singh and V.K. Singh 

be easily confused with that of N because onset of K deficiency is visible as a color  
change of lower leaves. Typical symptoms of K deficiency in rice include stunted  
plants with little or no reduction in tillering, droopy and dark green upper leaves,  
and chlorosis of the interveinal areas and margins of the lower leaves starting at the  
leaf tip (Fageria et al. 2003). Leaf symptoms of K deficiency can be confused with  
that of tungro disease, but tungro occurs in patches in a field and usually has more  
pronounced  yellow  and  orange  leaves  and  plant  stunting.  Potassium  deficiency  
leads to direct yield loss due to reduced size and weight of rice grains. 
    Potassium  increases  the  number  of  spikelets  per  panicle,  percentage  of  filled  
grains, and 1000-grain weight but does not have a pronounced effect on tillering of  
rice. Incidence of diseases such as brown leaf spot, cercospora leafspot, bacterial  
leaf blight, sheath blight, sheath rot, stem rot, and blast is greater where excessive N  
fertilizer  and  insufficient  K  fertilizer  have  been  applied.  Deficiency  of  K  in  rice  
occurs due to excessive use of N or N + P fertilizers with insufficient K application  
in direct-sown rice during early growth stages when the plant population is large  
and root system is shallow, and in hybrid rice because of greater demand for K  
(Fairhurst et al. 2007). The extent of rice response to K application is less than that  
observed for N and P, although above-ground K content of rice is equal to or greater  
than  the  plant  N  content  and  greater  than  all  other  essential  nutrients. As  rice,  
because of its fibrous root system, is highly efficient in scavenging plant available  
soil K, many soils can support the production of continuous rice or rice–wheat rota- 
tions for extended periods without a need to apply K to maintain high yield levels  
(Dobermann et al. 1996b). However, in some soils, regular applications of K fertil- 
izer to rice are needed to avoid K deficiency. Yield responses of 0–10 % to direct K  
fertilization of rice are normally observed (Dobermann et al. 1996b). Prior to 1990s,  
K was rarely applied to rice in United States and South Asia. But due to production  
of high yields of rice and other crops for many years in these regions, soils have  
been mined of K so that regular applications of K fertilizer have become necessity  
to  produce  optimum  yields  of  rice  (Bijay-Singh  et  al.  2004;  Slaton  et  al.  1995;  
Williams and Smith 2001). 
   Weathering of soil minerals—primary alumino silicates that include K feldspars  
and  micas  and  secondary  alumino  silicates  like  illite—releases  K  in  the  soil.  
Potassium exists in four distinct pools in the soil—soil solution K (0.1–0.2 %),  
exchangeable K (1–2 %), nonexchangeable K (1–10 %), and mineral K (90–98 %).  
K ions move from one pool to another whenever the removal or addition of K dis- 
turbs the equilibrium between these pools (Barber  1995). Equilibration between  
the soil solution and exchangeable K pools is rapid and is usually completed within  
hours. Although considered immobile, a significant amount of K can be lost via  
leaching on some soils following displacement from the exchange complex after  
flooding.  Leaching  is  a  significant  problem  in  soils  with  low  cation  exchange  
capacities  (Bijay-Singh  et  al.  2004;  Fageria  et  al.  1990). Yadvinder-Singh  et  al.  
(2005) found that leaching losses of K were 22 and 16 % of the applied K, respec- 
tively, in sandy loam and loamy soils maintained at submerged moisture regimes.  
Increased amount of K in the soil solution is absorbed by rice plants or leached to  
depths below the rice root system in permeable soils (Wells et al. 1993). If adequate

amount of K is not absorbed by rice during vegetative stage and significant amount  
of soil K gets lost via leaching, K deficiency may occur later in the growing season  
unless K is not supplemented shortly before the onset of reproductive growth. 

10.4.1       Critical Levels of K in Rice and Uptake of K 

According to Yoshida ( 1981), during the vegetative growth phase of rice, tillering  
stops when the K concentration in the leaf blade is <5.0 g kg−1 of leaf dry weight.  

For maximum number of grains per panicle and reduced spikelet sterility, mature  
leaves should contain more than 20 g K kg−1 at booting stage of rice (Kiuchi and  
Ishizaka  1961). According to De Datta (1981), straw K concentration <10 g K kg−1  

at maturity certainly indicated K deficiency. 
   Luxury consumption of K by rice may occur but the K concentration of rice seed  
remains relatively constant between 2.5 and 3.0 kg K kg−1 regardless of K fertiliza- 

tion (Dobermann et al.  1998). Rice absorbs most of its K during the vegetative and  
early  reproductive  growth  stages  and  a  major  portion  of  the  K  absorbed  before  
anthesis remains in the stems and leaves (Hirata  1995). Around 80–90 % of the  
above-ground K content of rice remains in leaves and stems at maturity (Dobermann  
et al.  1996a). Thus, if the rice straw is not physically removed from the field, the  
majority of K is recycled back into the soil. Otherwise K fertilization practices must  
be modified to prevent depletion of soil K. 

10.4.2      Potassium      Management Strategies in Rice 

Where soil K supply is small, the general strategy for K management for rice is to  
apply 25 kg K ha−1 for each tonne of target grain yield increase over the yield of rice  

in the plots receiving no fertilizer K (Fairhurst et al. 2007). According to Dobermann  
et al. (2000), 50 kg K ha−1 should normally be applied to obtain maximum yields of  

flooded rice and this rate is representative of K fertilizer rates used to fertilize rice  
in other parts of the world. Since more than 80 % of K taken up by rice remains in  
the straw after harvest, straw should be considered as an important input source  
when calculating K requirements. Many times significant responses of rice to K  
application are not observed because of high seasonal K inputs (7–60 kg K ha−1 year−1)  

via irrigation water and release of nonexchangeable K (Forno et al. 1975). The stan- 
dard  approach  for  the  identification  of  K-deficient  soils  or  plant  K  deficiency  
revolves around rapid chemical tests with empirical critical threshold ranges. This  
approach requires conducting large number of field experiments to establish cali- 
brations  between  a  given  soil  K  test  value  and  the  probability  of  a  response  to  
applied K (McLean and Watson  1985; Sekhon  1995). Most of these calibrations  
provide reliable measures of the soil K-supplying power only for specific soil types  
such as those with relatively high native fertility and little K fixation character, and  

----------------------- Page 242-----------------------

238                                                                      Bijay-Singh and V.K. Singh 

provide reasonable recommendations for fertilizer K application to rice. However,  
this approach is inadequate for intensive irrigated rice systems in the tropics and  
subtropics, which are extremely K demanding with two and sometimes three rice  
crops each year grown in submerged soil with soil drying in fallow periods or when  
rice is grown in rotation with an upland crop like wheat. Extractable soil K levels  
can  fluctuate  enormously  under  alternating  aerobic–anaerobic  soil  conditions  or  
                                                                               + 
when soils have strong K-fixation properties. Extractable soil K  is still considered  
as the most important indicator of available K in rice soils, but its suitability as a  
measure of plant available K remains controversial, especially when soils with dif- 
ferent textures and clay mineralogy are considered (Kemmler  1980; Sekhon 1995).  
Generally accepted critical level of 1 N ammonium acetate extractable K in rice  
soils is 0.17–0.21 cmol K kg−1. In the United States, K fertilizer is usually recom- 
mended for rice when exchangeable soil K is <60 mg K kg−1, regardless of the soil  

texture or the extractant (Williams and Smith 2001). Fageria (1999) observed that  
rice   did   not   respond   to   K   fertilization   when   soil   test   concentrations   were  
>50  mg  K  dm−3  (Mehlich  1  or  0.05  N  HCl  +  0.025  N  H SO   extractable  K).  
                                                                             2    4 

Dobermann  et  al.  ( 1996b)  found  that  mixed-bed  exchange  resins  incubated  for  
2 weeks under flooded soil conditions were superior to K extracted by 1 N ammo- 
nium acetate for prediction of K uptake by rice. 
    In more than 25 M ha area in China and Indo-Gangetic plains in South Asia, rice  
is grown in an annual rotation with wheat. In a number of long-term experiments on  
rice–wheat systems located all over the Indo-Gangetic plain, average grain yield  
response to application of 33 kg K ha−1 to rice ranged from 0 to 0.5 t ha−1; the low  

response to fertilizer K in these alluvial soils suggests that release of K from illitic  
minerals  could  meet  the  K  needs  of  these  crops  (Bijay-Singh  et  al.  2004).  In  a  
 long- term experiment in Hubei province in China, Chen ( 1997) observed that the  
direct response of wheat to K application was larger than that of rice, while the  
residual response of rice was larger than that of wheat. In a large number of bal- 
anced fertilization demonstration trials carried out during more than a decade in  
southern  China,  application  of  48–75  kg  K  ha−1  to  rice  resulted  in  grain  yield  

response   of   7.9–61.3   %   (Scientific   Technology   Department   of   Ministry   of  
Agriculture 1991). In general, K application showed larger yield responses on wheat  
than on rice. Thus, when fertilizer K is not available in sufficient quantity, it should  
be preferably applied to wheat rather than rice. 
    Fertilizer K is applied to rice by broadcast method immediately before or after  
seeding/transplanting, or split into multiple applications. In general, a major por- 
tion, and sometimes all, of the K fertilizer should be applied at or near the time of  
seeding/transplanting of rice (Bijay-Singh et al. 2004; Fageria et al. 2003). A smaller  
portion of the total K fertilizer requirement should be top-dressed on soils where  
leaching losses of K are of concern. In the humid tropical soils with low cation  
exchange capacity and clay content, fertilizer K is commonly broadcast applied as  
a top-dressing along with N. Fageria (1991) reported that lowland rice yields were  
higher when the total K fertilizer requirement was applied in split top-dressed appli- 
cations. In a silt loam, a single application of K fertilizer applied at five-leaf stage,  
or  at  the  panicle  initiation  stage  was  sufficient  to  maximize  grain  yield  of  rice;

K fertilizer applied during the boot stage did not increase yields above the untreated  
control  (Slaton  et  al.  2001).  Foliar  sprays  may  also  be  considered  as  beneficial  
methods of K application (Bijay-Singh et al.  2004). Due to low cost and high K  
analysis, KCl is the most common source of K. However, its use in salt-affected  
areas is discouraged. Potassium sulfate can supply both K and S, but it is more  
expensive than KCl. In South Asia, 99 % of the total fertilizer K applied is KCl and  
no significant difference in rice response has been observed between KCl and potas- 
sium sulfate (Tandon and Sekhon 1988). 

10.5      Zinc 

Zinc (Zn) deficiency in rice occurs after transplanting and is a widespread phenom- 
enon limiting productivity under lowland conditions (Quijano-Guerta et al. 2002).  
Zinc is a cofactor for enzymes such as glutamate dehydrogenase and alcohol dehy- 
drogenase that are involved in N metabolism. Deficiency of Zn depresses the activ- 
ity of alcohol dehydrogenase, decreases anaerobic root metabolism, and reduces the  
ability of rice seedlings to withstand anaerobic soil conditions (Moore and Patrick  
1988). Rice plants in early growth stages are more susceptible to Zn deficiency. If  
the deficiency is not corrected, it can also affect plants in the reproductive growth  
phase. As Zn is not very mobile within the plant, its deficiency symptoms are first  
observed in the youngest leaves, which usually become chlorotic at the leaf base  
during early stages of Zn deficiency. The midribs and base of older leaves may also  
turn yellow or pale green with brown blotches and streaks when Zn deficiency pro- 
gresses (Yoshida  1981). According to Mueller (1974), Zn deficiency tends to be  
more severe when high rates of N and P are applied. Application of high rates of P  
fertilizers may aggravate Zn deficiency due to formation of Zn phosphate in soil  
solution and/or inhibitory effect of excessive P on the metabolic functions of Zn  
within the plant (Shimada  1995). Rice is considered susceptible to Zn deficiency  
because inadequate Zn levels in the soil limit tillering and, consequently, the num- 
ber of panicles per unit area (Fageria 2001). Zinc deficiency is becoming one of the  
major public health problems in many countries, especially where people rely on  
cereal-based food (Cakmak 2008). 
   Rice yield losses due to Zn deficiency range from 10 to 60 % (Slaton et al. 2002).  
Nevertheless, yield losses are small if Zn deficiency is recognized quickly and the  
appropriate  corrective  actions  are  taken.  Data  generated  in  different  parts  of  the  
world support that seedling Zn concentrations <15–20 mg Zn kg−1 are low or defi- 

cient and require Zn fertilization for optimum rice growth (Fageria et al.  2003).  
According to Adriano ( 1986), Zn deficiency of rice seedlings is likely when leaf or  
whole plant concentrations are <15 mg Zn kg−1. Concentrations of Ca, Cu, Fe, Mg,  

and Mn tend to be higher in Zn-deficient rice. However, tissue concentrations of N  
and K are reduced indicating inhibition in their uptake (Moore and Patrick 1988). 
   Zinc  concentration  in  the  soil  solution  decreases  after  flooding,  though  it  
may  temporarily  increase  immediately,  but  equilibrates  around  0.3–0.5  μM

240                                                                     Bijay-Singh and V.K. Singh 

(Forno et al.  1975). Zinc uptake by rice depends not only on the concentration  
of Zn in the soil solution, but also on the concentrations of Fe2+ and Mn2+ in the  

soil solution that increases with flooding of the soil. A decrease in available Zn  
concentration in the soil is also associated with high P availability, precipitation  
of Zn(OH)  with an increase in pH, formation of insoluble franklinite (ZnFe O ) 2               2  4 
and ZnS in acidic soils and ZnCO  in calcareous soils. Leached, old acid-sul-3 
fate, sodic, saline-neutral, calcareous, peat, sandy, highly weathered, acid, and  
coarse-textured soils and those with high available P and Si status are particu- 
larly prone to Zn deficiency. In alkaline soils and those rich in organic matter,  
Zn and P availability may be decreased by adsorption to amorphous Fe hydrox- 
ides  and  carbonates,  particularly  under  fluctuating  water  regimes  (Kirk  and  
Bajita  1995). 
    Application of suitable Zn fertilizers at the proper rates based on soil testing  
and at appropriate crop growth stages is the best method to ensure that Zn nutri- 
tion is not a yield-limiting factor for rice production. Some critical soil levels for  
occurrence  of  Zn  deficiency  are  (i)  0.6  mg  Zn  kg−1extractable  with  1  N  NH - 
                                                                                                   4 
acetate, pH 4.8, (ii) 1.0 mg Zn kg−1 extractable with 0.05 N HCl, and (iii) 2.0 mg  
Zn kg−1 extractable with 0.1 N HCl (Fairhurst et al. 2007). Critical DTPA extract- 
able soil Zn concentration of 0.8 mg Zn kg−1 has been reported for Indian soils for  

lowland rice (Tiwari and Dwivedi  1994). According to Sims and Johnson ( 1991),  
critical soil Zn concentration range for most crops is between 0.5 and 2.0 mg Zn  
kg−1 for DTPA and 0.5–3.0 mg Zn kg−1 for Mehlich 1 (0.05 N HCl + 0.025 N  

H SO  extractable). As reviewed by Fageria et al. (2003), this range is true for rice 2 4 
as well. When soil test for available Zn is not available but Zn deficiency symp- 
toms are observed in the field, broadcasting 10–25 kg ZnSO ·H O or 20–40 kg 4    2 
ZnSO  ·7H O per ha over the soil surface is recommended. Apply 0.5–1.5 kg Zn 4 2 
ha−1 as a foliar spray (a 0.5 % ZnSO  solution at about 200 L water per ha) for  
                                               4 

emergency treatment of Zn deficiency in growing plants (Fairhurst et al.  2007).  
Fertilizer Zn should be applied immediately at the onset of symptoms. The com- 
mercially  manufactured  granular  Zn  fertilizers  are  Zn  sulfates,  oxides,  oxysul- 
fates, lignosulfonates, and a number of organic chelated materials like ZnEDTA  
and ZnHEDTA, but highly water-soluble ZnSO  is the most commonly used Zn 4 
fertilizer. Liscano et al. (2001) suggested that 40–50 % Zn in the fertilizer should  
be water soluble to optimize Zn uptake by rice seedlings. The recommended rates  
of soil applied Zn are about 20 times higher than the total crop uptake of Zn. Thus,  
a  single  Zn  fertilizer  application  should  provide  adequate  Zn  for  several  years  
before additional Zn fertilizer is needed. Relatively high rates of Zn fertilizers are  
applied to the soil before seeding. On high pH soils, surface application of Zn  
fertilizers  has  been  more  effective  than  soil  incorporation.  Yoshida  ( 1981)  
observed that dipping rice seedling roots in a 1 % ZnO suspension before trans- 
planting could prevent Zn deficiency. Fairhurst et al. (2007) recommended dip- 
ping of rice seedlings or presoak seeds in a 2–4 % ZnO suspension. Lowering the  
pH of alkaline or calcareous soils by application of acid forming fertilizers and  
amendments  like  elemental  S  has  shown  improvement  in  Zn  availability  and  
uptake by rice (Slaton  1998).

10.6       Sulfur 

Sulfur (S) as an essential plant nutrient is a constituent of amino acids like cysteine  
and methionine, several coenzymes like biotin, and lipoic acid, thioredoxins, and  
sulfolipids (Zhao et al.  1997). Deficiency symptoms of S are similar to those for N  
but due to limited mobility of S in the plant, chlorosis of the plant is rather uniform.  
Sulfur deficiency is initially expressed as chlorosis of the younger leaves while N  
deficiency results in chlorosis of older leaves. Reduction in the dry weight of leaf  
blades is larger than in stems and roots when there is S deficiency. In rice, number of  
panicles and panicle length may be adversely affected by S deficiency (Fageria et al.  
2003). Critical concentration of S in rice varies from 2.5 g S kg−1 at tillering stage to  

             −1 
1.0 g S kg      at heading (Wells et al.  1993). According to Wang (1976), critical con- 
centration of S in straw should be 0.5 g S kg−1 for optimum grain yield. De Datta  
(1981) reported that S concentration in rice grain varies between 0.34 g S kg−1 for  
S-deficient plants and 1.6 g S kg−1 in plants that show no response to S application. 

    Deficiency of S has been reported from nearly all rice-producing regions of the Asia  
(Khurana et al. 2008). Low S content of most tropical soils, use of S-free fertilizers (urea  
substituted for (NH ) SO , triple superphosphate substituted for single superphosphate, 4 2 4 
and KCl substituted for K SO ), depletion of soil S due to intensive cropping, and low 2 4 
inputs of atmospheric S due to reduced industrial emissions are the possible reasons.  
Plant available S decreases rapidly when soil reduction proceeds under lowland rice.  
Besides uptake of S by plants, SO42− may get leached and reduced to S2−, which can be  

toxic to plants and may also be lost from the soil as H S gas. According to Ponnamperuma 2 
                                                            2−    −1 
(1972), S concentrations as high as 15,000 mg SO4              kg    may be reduced to zero within  
6 weeks of submergence of neutral and alkaline soils. 
    According to Fairhurst et al. (2007), soil tests for S are not reliable unless these  
include inorganic S as well as some of the mineralizable organic S fraction (ester  
sulfates). The critical levels for S deficiency in soils are: <5 mg S kg−1 extractable  
with 0.05 M HCl, or <6 mg S kg−1 extractable with 0.25 M KCl heated at 40 °C for  
3 hours, or <9 mg S kg−1: 0.01 M extractable with 0.04 M Ca(H PO ) . The critical  
                                                                                2    4 2 
S concentration in rice tissue varies from 2.5 g S kg−1 at tillering to 1.0 g S kg−1 at  

heading (Wells et al. 1993). Pillai and Singh (1975) reported 0.16 % S as the critical  
concentration at tillering stage of rice grown in calcareous soils. Yoshida ( 1981)  
observed that the critical S concentrations in straw needed for maximum dry weight  
production varied from 1.6 g S kg−1 at tillering to 0.7 g S kg−1 at maturity. Wang  
(1976) reported a critical concentration of S in rice straw as 0.5 g S kg−1. For low- 
land rice grain yields of 5–7 t ha−1, S uptake was between 5 and 9 kg S ha−1. 

    Soils  particularly  prone  to  S  deficiency  are  (i)  those  containing  allophane  
(Andisols), (ii) those with low organic matter status, (iii) highly weathered and con- 
taining large amounts of Fe oxides, (iv) light textured, which are easily leached, and  
(v) highly reduced clay soils that are continuously cropped with rice. Hoque and  
Hobbs ( 1980) reported that in Bangladesh, an average application of 34 kg S ha−1 as  
(NH ) SO  increased the yield of rice by 100 to 1300 kg ha−1 and on farmers’ fields  
      4 2    4 
by 300 to 2200 kg ha−1 over and above the yield obtained due to application of

242                                                                       Bijay-Singh and V.K. Singh 

60 kg N ha−1. Irrigation water frequently contains adequate amounts of SO42− to  

supply seasonal crop requirements. If S deficiency is identified during early growth,  
the response to S fertilizer is rapid and recovery from S deficiency symptoms can  
occur  within  5  days  of  S  fertilizer  application. Where  moderate  S  deficiency  is  
observed,  10  kg  S  ha−1  may  be  applied.  On  soils  with  severe  S  deficiency,  
20–40 kg S ha−1 may be applied (Fairhurst et al. 2007). According to Wang (1976),  
at least 10 kg S ha−1 is required from fertilizer for rice production and (NH ) SO  or  
                                                                                            4 2    4 
single superphosphate are good sources of S. Also, 27 kg S ha−1 applied once sup- 

ported two crops of rice. Yamaguchi ( 1997) reported that a mixture of (NH ) SO  4               2    4 
and urea increased rice dry matter production when the proportion of (NH ) SO  4                 2    4 
supplied more than 25 % of the total N application. Elemental S can also be used as  
a source of S provided an adequate time interval is allowed for the oxidation of S  
into a plant available form. When the availability of S is initially low, SO42− contain- 

ing fertilizers should be applied at seeding or by the five-leaf stage when rapid plant  
growth and tillering begin. The application of S containing fertilizers may also be  
necessary during the reproductive growth phase to prevent late-season S deficiency  
on highly permeable or reduced soils. Some preventive strategies for S management  
in rice could be (i) application of S to the rice nursery, (ii) incorporation of rice  
straw instead of removing or burning it because 40–60 % of the S contained in straw  
is   lost   due   to   straw   burning,   (iii)   maintaining   sufficient   percolation   (about  
5 mm day−1) to avoid excessive soil reduction, and (iv) carrying out dry tillage after  

harvesting to increase the rate of sulfide oxidation during the fallow period. 

10.7       Iron 

Iron (Fe) is required for photosynthesis. Its deficiency may inhibit K absorption. Iron  
is not highly mobile within the plant and the youngest leaves are the first to show its  
deficiency  symptoms.  Interveinal  yellowing  and  chlorosis  of  emerging  leaves  are  
observed at the onset of Fe deficiency. Further progression of Fe deficiency results in  
uniform pale yellow to bleached appearance (Snyder and Jones  1988). 
    Iron deficiency occurs commonly in rainfed upland rice, rainfed dry nurseries, or  
when rice is grown under upland conditions. Rice seedlings before flooding are the  
most susceptible to Fe deficiency (Yoshida  1981) because rice roots produce com- 
paratively low amounts of iron-chelating phytosiderophores compared to other grass  
species (Mori et al. 1991). Deficiency of Fe most often occurs when rice is grown on  
neutral, calcareous, and alkaline upland soils, alkaline and calcareous lowland soils  
with  low  organic  matter  content,  lowland  soils  irrigated  with  alkaline  irrigation  
water, and coarse-textured soils derived from granite. Major causes of Fe deficiency  
in rice are low concentration of soluble Fe2+ in upland soils, insufficient soil reduc- 

tion under submerged conditions (low organic matter status of soils), high pH of  
alkaline or calcareous soils following submergence (decreased solubility and uptake  
of Fe because of large bicarbonate concentrations), and wide P:Fe ratio in the soil (Fe  
bound in Fe phosphates, possibly because of the excessive application of P) (Fairhurst  

----------------------- Page 247-----------------------

10   Fertilizer Management in Rice                                                          243 

et al. 2007). Thus, Fe deficiency does not commonly occur in flooded rice due to the  
increase in Fe availability associated with the anaerobic soil conditions. As solubility  
of Fe increases during organic matter decomposition in flooded soils, Fe deficiency  
may occur when organic matter decomposition is insufficient. 
   Iron has a relatively wide sufficiency concentration range in plants. Sufficient  
Fe  concentration  range  in  the  youngest  mature  leaf  blade  during  vegetative  
growth has been reported to be 75–150 mg Fe kg−1 (Dobermann and Fairhurst  

2000). The sufficient Fe concentration of the whole shoots was somewhat lower  
at 60–100 mg Fe kg−1. As for other nonmobile elements, Fe concentration in rice  

leaves increases with age. Soil analysis is not an effective means of identifying  
Fe-deficient soils. 
   Applications of inorganic Fe sources such as FeSO  to soil are often ineffective 4 
in controlling Fe deficiency unless large amounts are applied. According to Fairhurst  
et al. (2007), Fe deficiency can best be treated by applying solid FeSO  (about 30 kg 4 
Fe ha−1) next to rice rows, or broadcast (larger application rate required) along with  

organic  matter  through  crop  residues,  green  manures,  or  animal  manures.  Foliar  
applications of FeSO  (2–3 % solution) or Fe chelates can also be used to cure Fe 4 
deficiency. Due to low Fe mobility in the plant, two to three applications at 2-week  
intervals (starting at tillering) are necessary to support new plant growth. Use of  
acidifying fertilizers such as (NH ) SO  instead of urea on high-pH soils can also be 4 2 4 
helpful. In coarse textured soils, incorporation of 10 t ha−1 of a green manure plus  

submergence for 10 days followed by raising upland rice nursery checked Fe chlo- 
rosis (Sharma and Katyal  1982). 

10.8      Manganese 

Manganese (Mn) is found in chloroplast and along with Fe and Cu performs vital  
role in the electron transport system (Obata  1995). It is involved in photosynthetic  
oxygen evolution and functions as a co-factor to activate enzymes such as dehydro- 
genases.  The  protease  enzyme  contained  in  rice  seeds  is  also  activated  by  Mn.  
Manganese is immobile in plants so that its deficiency symptoms appear initially in  
the  younger  leaves.  Chlorosis  and  development  of  an  irregular  yellow  mottling  
between the leaf veins are the typical symptoms of Mn deficiency in rice. 
   The role of Mn is closely associated with that of Fe as it supports the movement  
of Fe in the plant. Manganese is also required for photosynthesis. Manganese defi- 
ciency is more often observed in upland rice, alkaline and calcareous soils with low  
organic matter status and small amounts of reducible Mn, degraded paddy soils high  
in Fe content, acid upland (Oxisols, Ultisols), leached old acid sulfate soils with low  
base content, leached sandy soils containing small amounts of Mn, or in excessively  
limed acid soils. Uptake of Mn is also reduced because of hydrogen sulfide accumu- 
lation or large concentrations of Ca2+, Mg2+, Zn2+, or NH4+ in the soil solution. The  

adequate Mn concentration for rice growth in water culture experiments has been  
reported as 0.1–0.5 mg L−1 (Shimada  1995).

244                                                                      Bijay-Singh and V.K. Singh 

    Critical soil levels for occurrence of Mn deficiency in the soil are 1.0 mg Mn kg−1  
extractable with terephthalic acid + CaCl , pH 7.3 or 2.0 mg Mn kg−1, extractable  
                                                   2 

with 1 N NH -acetate + 0.2 % hydroquinone, pH 7 (Fairhurst et al. 2007). Manganese 4 
deficiency in rice occurs when the Mn concentration in the plant tissue is less than  
20 mg Mn kg−1 (Wells et al.  1993). Deficiency of Mn can be corrected by foliar  

application of Mn or by banding Mn with an acidifying starter fertilizer. Manganese  
sulfate or finely ground MnO (5–20 kg Mn ha−1) can be applied in bands along rice  

rows. For rapid treatment of Mn deficiency, foliar spray with MnSO  solution (1–5 kg 4 
Mn ha−1 in 200 L water ha−1) can be effectively adopted. Chelates are less effective  

because Fe and Cu displace Mn. Application of farmyard manure and acid forming  
fertilizer such as (NH ) SO  can prevent Mn deficiency in rice (Fairhurst et al. 2007).4 2 4 

10.9       Boron 

Boron  (B)  is  an  important  constituent  of  cell  walls  and  its  deficiency  results  in  
reduced pollen viability. As B is not retranslocated to new growth, deficiency symp- 
toms usually appear as white, rolled leaf tips of young leaves. Boron deficiency in  
rice may be expressed solely in the form of reduced grain yield from floret sterility.  
Okuda et al. (1961) observed that panicles of B-deficient rice plants failed to come  
out from the boot. The critical soil level for occurrence of B deficiency is 0.5 mg   
B kg−1 hot water extraction (Fairhurst et al. 2007). While Fageria et al. ( 1997) sug- 
gested a critical concentration of 8 mg B kg−1 in rice leaves at maturity, Yu and Bell  
(1998) reported that 18.5 mg B kg−1 in rice leaves and 8.9 mg B kg−1 in rice stems  

were associated with optimum rice yields. Boron deficiency in rice may be cor- 
rected by applying B in soluble forms as borax (0.5–3 kg B ha−1) (Fairhurst et al.  

2007). Borax should be broadcast and incorporated before planting, top-dressed, or  
as foliar spray during vegetative rice growth. 

10.10        Integrated Plant Nutrient Management in Rice 

The integrated plant nutrient management (IPNM) aims to judiciously manipulate  
the nutrient stocks and flows to maintain and improve fertility and health of the soil  
for  sustained  crop  productivity  on  long-term  basis  and  use  fertilizer  nutrients  as  
supplement to nutrients supplied by different organic sources available at the farm.  
The IPNM in rice has great impact in terms of maintaining health of soils that are  
low in organic matter content as are commonly found in South Asia (Katyal et al.  
2001). In recent years, a large number of long-term experiments on rice-based crop- 
ping systems in South Asia have shown that integrated management of different  
organic materials and mineral fertilizers resulted in positive impact on the yield of  
rice along with build-up of soil organic matter. Ladha et  al. (2003) analyzed 12  
rice–wheat long-term experiments and concluded that annual rate of yield change in

rice was significantly higher with integrated management of organic manures and  
fertilizers as compared with the NPK treatment. 

10.11       Conclusions 

Fertilizers account for 20–25 % of total production costs in lowland rice systems.  
Therefore, increasing the yield of rice per unit area through the use of appropriate  
nutrient management practices has become an essential component of modern rice  
production technology. It has been endeavored to manage nutrients in the form of  
recommendations consisting of optimum fertilizer N rates, improved methods and  
timings of application and placement and new forms of fertilizers. Development of  
efficient practices for managing different nutrients in rice has been possible by inte- 
grating basic knowledge of soil properties, nutrient cycles, chemical and biochemi- 
cal transformation processes, and rice growth and nutrient uptake under flooded soil  
conditions.  These  agronomically  and  environmentally  efficient  nutrient  manage- 
ment strategies are already recommended in many rice-producing regions. 
   To achieve high recovery efficiency of nutrient applied as fertilizers, agronomic effi- 
ciency and rice yield levels through better synchronization between the supply and the  
uptake of nutrients by the crop, a shift from blanket fertilizer recommendations to site- 
specific need-based fertilizer management scenarios is being made. New innovations in  
the management of N, P, K, and micronutrients in rice are evolving as our understanding  
increases about the fate of these elements under the emerging soil–water–crop scenarios  
based on salt- and drought-tolerant rice cultivars or new plant types for irrigated rice  
ecosystems, enhanced nutritional quality of rice grain through breeding, biotechnologi- 
cal approaches, integrated rice crop management with fine tuning of production tech- 
nologies to reduce the cost of production and enhance productivity, production of rice  
under climate change adaptive technologies, mechanization of rice farming to sustain  
rice productivity, and conservation of natural resources like land, water, and labor. The  
challenge ahead is to continue incorporating new and emerging technologies into practi- 
cal  management  recommendations  so  that  all  rice  farmers,  even  those  with  limited  
resources, can adopt the efficient nutrient management practices to produce enough rice  
for everyone and with minimal damage to the environment.

Water Management in Rice

11.1       Introduction 

11.1.1       Background  

Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is grown in at least 114 countries of the world, and more than  
50 of them produce equal to or more than 100,000 t year−1. About 491.4 million tons  

(mt) of rough rice was produced worldwide from 160.6 million hectares (m ha) of land  
in 2015 (FAO 2015). Rice, maize (Zea mays L.), and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) are  
the main staple food sources for human, but rice becomes the most important with  
respect to human nutrition and caloric intake as maize is used for purposes other than  
human consumption. Most of the countries consume their own rice; therefore, the  
economic importance of rice is different from other export commodities, and only  
5–6 % export occurs worldwide. 
    Rice is not exclusively a wetland plant (hydrophyte), but its growth in inundated  
conditions (5–10 cm water layer) is being practiced for a long time. The reasons for  
growing rice in inundated conditions are mostly agronomic, and it would be possi- 
ble to grow rice in less water environments like other crops. The main agronomic  
advantages associated with this practice are suppression of weeds, ease of plowing,  
storage of water from heavy rainfall (particularly during monsoon season), and pro- 
vision of habitat for the growth of an aquatic fern Azolla . Azolla can play an impor- 
tant role in nitrogen (N) fertilization of rice fields by making symbiotic association

with a cyanobacteria/blue-green alga (Anabaena azollae). The demand for rice is  
increasing  with  growing  population,  while  water  resources  are  getting  scarce.  
Hence,  the  rice-growing  practices  requiring  less  water  input  are  needed  to  be  
adapted.  The  benefits  associated  with  growing  rice  under  inundated  conditions  
could be achieved even without this practice, for example, by plowing, fertilizing,  
and  weeding  through  tractors  and  spraying  of  herbicides.  High  labor  needs  and  
emission of more greenhouse gases under wet conditions are the other problems  
associated with rice production under inundated conditions. 
    Alternate wetting and drying (AWD) and aerobic rice provide a respective 38  
and 40 % reduction in water input (Lampayan et al. 2015; Peng et al. 2006) to rice  
over the conventional flooding; however, the farmers are reluctant to adopt these  
practices because of possible yield reduction and certain information gaps regarding  
these systems. The existing practice of rice cultivation where fields are kept continu- 
ously  flooded  is  more  popular  among  farmers  because  of  weed  suppression  and  
higher yield. However, this practice causes excessive water loss due to higher seep- 
age, percolation, and evapotranspiration (Grassi et al. 2009). Moreover, changing  
climate with a direct effect on agricultural water availability is a serious threat for  
the existing systems of rice cultivation (Yoo et al. 2012). Changing climate scenar- 
ios (warming in particular) is expected to cause a 13–23 % rise in irrigation water  
requirement for rice cultivation (De Silva et al. 2007; Thomas 2008; Shahid 2011;  
Chung et al. 2011). The factors lowering the productivity of rice and diminishing its  
optimum performance under low water input systems are required to be understood.  
This  will  help  in  judicious  use  of  available  water  resources  for  sustainable  rice  
production. 

11.1.2       Rice Environments  

Unlike other food crops, rice has a wide range of ecological amplitude and can be  
grown in a variety of habitats with different hydrological conditions, climate, and  
soil types (Bouman et al. 2007). Rice is unique among cereals due to its ability to  
grow in wetland environment. Being an extremely versatile crop, rice can grow in  
dry and wetland conditions and low and high altitudes from the Mekong delta in  
Vietnam to the highlands of Madagascar (Seck et al. 2012). It has been reported that  
rice is grown on approximately 158 m ha of land worldwide producing more than  
700 m t in 2009 (IRRI, AfricaRice and CIAT 2010). The four main rice production  
environments based on its hydrology (Bouman et al.  2007; Seck et al. 2012) are  
summarized below: 

  (i)  Irrigated rice: Almost 75 % of the world rice production comes from irrigated  
      lowland rice with a cultivated area of about 85–90 m ha where the main source  
      of water is irrigation for at least 80 % of crop duration (IRRI, AfricaRice and  
      CIAT 2010). Global food security is largely dependent on this system. Farm  
      size for this type of rice cultivation system is small (0.5–2 ha) where rice is

11   Water Management in Rice                                                              257 

      cultivated once, twice, or thrice a year as monocrop or sometimes in rotation  
      with other crops such as wheat. In Asia, 56 % of the total rice-cultivated area  
      is under this system (Swain et al. 2005). Transplanting method of cultivation is  
      commonly used in irrigated rice production with bunded (diked) fields where  
      water is supplied by irrigation. The average yield is around 5.4 t ha−1. 

 (ii)  Rainfed lowland rice: Rainfall is the only source of water for rainfed lowland  
      rice production system. Fields for this system of cultivation are also bunded  
      and are flooded with rainwater for at least part of the cropping season. The  
      share of this system in global rice production is about 20 % with a cultivated  
      area of about 40–45 m ha (IRRI, AfricaRice and CIAT 2010). Nearly 26 % of  
      the total rice-cultivated area in Asia is under this system (Swain et al. 2005).  
      The average yield is low (1–2.5 t ha−1). Some of the major yield-limiting fac- 

      tors for this system include drought, flood, weed infestation, iron toxicity, and  
      disease (Seck et al. 2012). 
 (iii)  Rainfed  upland  rice:  Cultivation  of  rice  like  any  other  cereal  is  known  as  
      upland rice. Fields are characterized by well-drained, unsaturated, and aerobic  
      soil without any ponded water for more than 80 % of the crop growth period.  
      Broadcasting method is commonly used for this system where land is tilled  
      prior to starting of rainy season. No water is held on the surface as there is no  
      bunding. In Asia, only 9.2 % of rice-cultivated area falls under this system. The  
      major constraints for this system include erratic rainfall, poor weed control,  
      low  fertilizer  use,  and  high  disease  incidence.  The  average  yield  is  about  
      1 t ha−1 (Seck et al. 2012). 

 (iv)  Deep water or floating rice: Rice cultivated in areas where water depth reaches  
      1 m or more for a period of 10 days–5 months is called deep water or floating  
      rice (Seck et al. 2012). About 11–14 m ha of rice-cultivated area is under this  
      system across the globe. Commonly available varieties of rice are not suitable  
      for  this  system.  Rice  cultivated  under  this  system  has  some  special  genetic  
      characteristics.  These  are  quick  growth  and  stem/root  elongation  rate  of  as  
      high as 10 cm day−1 with the rise in floodwater and formation of adventitious  

      roots for direct absorption of nutrients from floodwater in addition to regular  
      root system grounded in the soil (Balasubramanian et al. 2007). 

11.2      Rice and Water Input 

Total water applied either through irrigation or precipitation to the rice production  
systems is collectively called water input (Jabran et al. 2015a). Water needed for  
rice cultivation is more than any other arable crops. Nearly 75 and 80 % of the total  
existing water resources of the world and Asia, respectively, are devoted to rice  
production (Bouman et al.  2007). Presently, the traditional ways of growing rice  
(flooding and puddling the soil followed by seedling transplanting) are increas- 
ingly becoming difficult due to acute water and labor shortage in major rice-pro- 
ducing  areas  of  the  world  (Farooq  et  al.  2011a;  Jabran  et  al.  2015a,  b).  Many

258                                                                                 A. Datta et al. 

alternate ways to the traditional system have been developed with a considerable  
water saving potential such as dry-seeded rice, aerobic rice, and transplanted rice  
with AWD. Water savings of 35–57 % have been reported for cultivating rice in  
non- flooded  and  non-puddled  soils  compared  with  traditional  transplanted  rice  
(Peng et al. 2006; Bhushan et al. 2007). Similarly, 32–88 % higher water produc- 
tivity  has  been  recorded  for  dry-seeded  rice  compared  with  transplanted  rice  
(Bouman et al. 2005). Water savings between 20 and 21 % and 32 and 34 % have  
been reported for transplanted rice with AWD and dry-seeded rice, respectively,  
compared  with  transplanted  rice  with  continuous  flooding  in  Punjab,  Pakistan  
(Jabran et al. 2015a). The average value of water input for irrigated rice in Asia is  
around 1300–1500 mm (Bouman et al. 2007). Total seasonal water input required  
for rice is up to two to three times higher than other cereals (Tuong et al. 2005).  
Soil texture plays an important role in deciding water input to rice. Water input  
could be as low as 400 mm for a heavy clay soil with shallow groundwater table to  
as high as 2000 mm for a coarse-textured soil (sandy or loamy) with deep ground- 
water table (Cabangon et al. 2004). Water requirement is the highest for irrigated  
lowland  rice  followed  by  rainfed  lowland  rice  (Bouman  et  al.  2007). This  high  
demand is due to high outflow by seepage, percolation and evapotranspiration dur- 
ing crop growth. With better crop and water management practices, the amount of  
water needed for lowland rice cultivation could be minimized. For example, reduc- 
ing the time lag between soaking and transplanting to a few days, the amount of  
water required for wet land preparation could be as low as 100–150 mm (Bouman  
et al. 2007). But in most of the cases with large-scale irrigation systems with poor  
water  control,  the  time  lag  between  soaking  and  transplanting  can  go  up  to  2  
months, and water inputs for land preparation can be as high as 940 mm (Bouman  
et al. 2007). 
    Transplanting and wet direct-seeding methods are generally used for lowland  
rice cultivation in Asia. Land preparation consisting of soaking, plowing, and pud- 
dling is an important step before practicing either of the methods. The water input  
in rice fields is not uniform (different amount of water is needed in different areas  
and different environments), and depends on various factors such as outflow rate,  
crop growth, duration and method used for land preparation. For modern high-  
yielding  varieties  with  a  typical  100-day  season,  the  total  input  of  water  varies  
from 700 to 5300 mm based on different factors such as soil characteristics, cli- 
mate, and hydrological conditions, while for many lowland areas, a typical value  
is  1000–2000  mm  (Tuong  and  Bouman  2003).  For  normal  growth  and  mainte- 
nance of flooded condition, it is necessary to match outflow of water. Major causes  
of outflow under flooded conditions are seepage and percolation to the surround- 
ings as well as evaporation and transpiration to the atmosphere. The resistance of  
soil to water movement and depth of ponded water mainly govern the flow rates of  
seepage and percolation, both of which are often considered in combination as it is  
difficult to separate these under field situations. Different stages in the crop growth  
period have different values of seepage and percolation, for example, seepage and  
percolation values during land preparation are reported as high as 25 mm day−1 due  

to cracks in the soil (Tuong et al.  1996). During the crop growth period, seepage

11   Water Management in Rice                                                             259 

and percolation values in heavy soil are reported between 1 and 5 mm day−1, and  
in sandy and sandy loam soil, these are between 25 and 30 mm day−1 (Wickham  

and Singh  1978; Jha et al.  1981). Evaporation and transpiration cannot be sepa- 
rated and a combined term evapotranspiration is used. Evaporation occurs during  
land preparation from moist soil (ponded water) and from soil and water surface  
between crops, whereas transpiration occurs from plant surfaces during the crop  
growth period. In Asia, evapotranspiration value ranges from 4 to 7 mm day−1 (De  

Datta  1981; Tuong 1999). Out of all these outflows from a rice field, transpiration  
is beneficial as it is directly involved in growth and yield. Seeping water could also  
be reused downstream in the catchment areas and might not be a true loss. Most of  
the water input to a rice field should compensate for all types of outflows such as  
seepage and percolation during land preparation and crop growth period and evap- 
oration during land preparation. All these flows have no role in plant growth and  
yield.

Water productivity can be defined as grain yield per unit of water supplied through  
irrigation (WP ), which is known as irrigation water productivity; or grain yield per I 
unit of water input (irrigation plus rainfall) (WPIR), which is known as total water  
productivity; or grain yield per unit of water loss through evapotranspiration (WPET),  
which is known as crop water productivity (Tuong and Bouman 2003; Timsina et al.  
2008). Water productivity values for either case are not consistent under field condi- 
tions. At field level, a typical value for WPIR is 0.2–1.1 g kg−1, and that of WPET  
ranges from 0.4–1.6 g kg−1 (Bouman and Tuong  2001). Different environmental  

conditions provide different values of evapotranspiration and different yields, and  
for this reason a wide variation exists for WPET values. Water productivity is also  
related to N fertilizer rate and other agronomic practices. Due to high unproductive  
outflows through seepage, percolation and evaporation from rice field, the value for  
WPIR for rice is less than half of many other C  crops. The value of WP3      ET for rice and  
other C  crops have little difference.3 
   Water productivity can be increased by adopting different water-saving practices  
such as improved irrigation management (Bouman and Tuong 2001), making effi- 
cient  use  of  rainfall  and  increasing  yield  per  unit  evapotranspiration  (Tuong  and  
Bouman 2003), growing short-duration cultivars (Bennett 2003) and growing of crop  
in the period of low evaporative demand by altering the date of transplanting and  
synchronization of growth cycle (Chahal et al. 2007; Timsina et al. 2008). There is  
an increased interest to develop water-saving rice production systems all over the  
world due to water shortage (Farooq et al. 2011a, b; Jabran et al. 2012a, b; Nie et al.  
2012). Dressing the soil surface with some amendments, such as mulches, could  
benefit rice production under water-limited environments by minimizing evaporative  
losses and enhancing soil water retention (Jabran et al.  2015a). Productive use of  
water in rice production (basmati rice) can be maximized by adjusting its  transplanting

time (Mahajan et al. 2015). In Northwest India, delaying transplanting of some pho- 
toperiod-insensitive  basmati  cultivars  resulted  in  higher  water   productivity  (WP , I 
WPIR,  and WPET)  from  reduced  irrigation  requirement  and  maintenance  of  grain  
yield as these cultivars matured almost 2–3 weeks earlier than other photoperiod-  
sensitive  cultivars  (Mahajan  et  al.  2015).  Short-duration  cultivars  mature  earlier;  
therefore, short-duration cultivars are better than medium- and long- duration culti- 
vars in water-saving rice cultivation systems (Mahajan et al. 2009). 

11.4       The Rice Plant and Drought 

Rice is the staple food for more than three billion people of the world, especially in  
developing countries in Asia where water shortage and drought are imminent threats  
to food and nutrition security. Water is the most important component for sustain- 
able rice production across the globe, especially in those areas where it is grown in  
traditional ways. Increased competition for water, reduced investments in irrigation  
infrastructure, water quality deterioration due to pollution and excessive withdraw- 
als of groundwater are some of the major problems that could pose serious threat for  
sustainable rice production (Lampayan et al. 2015). These issues seem to be even  
more severe in the future, but rice production must be significantly increased to  
meet the food demand of the world despite all these challenges. Therefore, the most  
viable option is the production of more rice with less water that would ensure the  
food, water, economic and social security of the world. 
    The main sources of water for rice are the river, the rain and groundwater; there- 
fore, the water scarcity paradigm needs to be carefully defined (Totin et al. 2013). In  
broad sense, water scarcity can be divided into two main types: meteorological and  
technical.  Meteorological  water  scarcity  is  caused  by  severe  reduction  in  normal  
rainfall than the mean annual rainfall or shifting of rainfall timing in a season (Totin  
et al. 2013). It has been reported that the current climate change is causing long-term  
shift  in  rainfall  timing  adding  additional  uncertainty  to  the  normal  variability  
(Nyakudya and Stroosnijder 2011). Both the gravity irrigated and rainfed crops are  
affected by low rainfall as there will be less water in the river and wells as well.  
Technical water scarcity is not due to unavailability of water rather it is caused by  
certain technical problems such as collapse of canal bank or very high intake of  
water at a level due to some technical defects in the irrigation infrastructure. In addi- 
tion,  improper  or  untimely  (late)  cleaning  of  irrigation  canals  also  causes  severe  
water shortages in the fields that are at high elevation in the command area. Presence  
of insufficient water to be pumped to upland part of inland valley is another technical  
issue that results in water scarcity (Totin et al. 2013). For example, in Indian State of  
Punjab, 97 % of the area is under irrigation (Hira 2009). A rapid fall of water table  
in Punjab is evident and is caused by excessive withdrawal of groundwater mainly  
due to early transplanting of rice and subsidized electricity to tube wells (Hira 2009).  
Nearly two-third fall in water table could be avoided by delaying rice transplanting  
from 10 to 30 June and shifting subsidies from input to output (Hira 2009).

11   Water Management in Rice                                                              261 

   The ancestors of cultivated rice were perennial semiaquatic plants (Lafitte and  
Bennett 2002), and this wetland ancestry of rice is evident in its various morpho- 
logical and physiological characteristics that are unique among cultivated crop spe- 
cies (Bouman et al. 2007). Lowland rice is extremely sensitive to drought, which is  
defined here as any situation where there is no standing water and the water content  
in the rooted soil is below saturation. The effect of drought on rice starts when soil  
moisture  level  drops  below  saturation  point.  Rice  uses  various  mechanisms  to  
respond  to  drought  conditions  summarized  by  Bouman  and  Tuong  (2001)  and  
Bouman et al. (2007) as follows: 

   (i)  Inhibition of leaf growth and decline in leaf area, leading to less light inter- 
       ception resulting in reduced rate of photosynthesis. Both cell division and cell  
       enlargement are affected by drought stress; however, cell enlargement is more  
       sensitive to drought stress than cell division. When soil moisture tension is  
       greater  than  1  kPa  (soil  dries  below  saturation),  leaf  area  expansion  starts  
       reducing in most of the cultivars, while for aerobic species, the same condi- 
       tion  starts  when  30  %  of  the  available  soil  moisture  has  been  extracted  
       (Wopereis et al. 1996). 
  (ii)  Stomatal closure, leading to reduced transpiration rate and photosynthesis.  
       The closure of stomata is not an immediate effect of drought stress and plants  
       keep their stomata open up to a certain time to maintain the process of photo- 
       synthesis. Assimilates produced during this time are not used for leaf growth,  
       but stored in leaves, stems or roots and the same may be used for leaf growth  
       and development on return of normal conditions. In some high-yielding vari- 
       eties (e.g., IR72), closing of stomata starts when soil moisture tension reaches  
       to 75 kPa (Wopereis et al.  1996). 
  (iii)  A rapid senescence of leaves in most cultivars causing a reduction in canopy  
       photosynthesis. 
   (iv)  Rolling of leaf to reduce effective leaf area for light interception. 
  (v)  Changes  in  assimilate  partitioning  where  roots  grow  more  (number  and  
       depth) during vegetative development compared with shoots. Deep root sys- 
       tems help absorb more water from the deeper soil layers. Assimilate partition- 
       ing among various shoot components is rarely affected. 
  (vi)  Reduction in plant height, which may or may not cause a reduction in yield. 
 (vii)  Delayed flowering. For photoperiod-insensitive varieties, a delay of 3–4 weeks  
       in flowering can be noted when drought stress is experienced during the veg- 
       etative  growth  stage.  The  drought  induced  delay  in  flowering,  however,  
       depends  on  the  crop  growth  stage  where  early-season  drought  has  more  
       severe effects than late-season drought. 
 (viii)  Reduced tillering and tiller death. The number of tillers and panicles per hill  
       are reduced when plants are exposed to drought stress. The effect is more  
       prominent when drought occurs before or during tillering stage. 
  (ix)  Reduced  number  of  spikelets  when  drought  stress  occurs  between  panicle  
       initiation  and  flowering,  leading  to  a  reduction  in  number  of  grains  per  
       panicle.

   (x)  Spikelet sterility occurs when drought stress is experienced around flowering  
        stage. This causes a reduction in number of filled spikelets resulting in less  
        number of grains per panicle. 
  (xi)  Decreased grain weight when drought affects the crop after flowering. 

    In the above consequences of drought stress on rice, some processes are irrevers- 
ible and cannot be restored such as leaf senescence, reduction in number of spike- 
lets,  spikelet  sterility  and  a  decrease  in  weight  of  grain,  whereas  some  other  
processes could be restored when drought is relieved such as leaf rolling and stoma- 
tal closure. Nutrient use efficiency may also be affected by drought stress. Overall,  
the effect of drought on rice yield depends on its timing, duration, frequency and  
severity (Bouman and Tuong 2001). 

11.5       Water Management Strategies for Rice 

11.5.1       Land Preparation  

One of the prerequisites for a good crop husbandry is a well-leveled field (Bouman  
et al. 2007). Higher parts of a field may become dry, whereas water may stagnate in  
lower parts when fields are not well-leveled, which could result in uneven early crop  
growth, unequal distribution of fertilizer and greater emergence of weeds. For any  
crop including rice, one of the basic technology options to help farmers cope with  
water scarcity at the field level is proper land preparation. A well-prepared field is  
important to ensure good water management, weed control, nutrient recycling and  
soil pathogen suppression. The important land preparation practices for good water  
management include tillage operations, field channels and land leveling (Bouman  
et al. 2007). 
    Laser leveling is a modern type of land leveling process during which the land  
surface  is  smoothened  (±  2  cm)  from  its  average  elevation  using  laser-equipped  
tractor-pulled scrapers. Large horsepower tractors and soil movers equipped with  
global positioning systems and/or laser-guided instrument are used for this practice  
for creating the desired soil slope/level either by cutting or filling. Laser leveling is  
an efficient technique used for achieving higher level of accuracy and has the poten- 
tial for water saving and higher crop yields. Some of the benefits associated with  
this technique include: 

  (i)  Uniform germination resulting in an improvement in crop establishment and  
      consequently high yield due to uniform soil moisture 
 (ii)  Improvement of irrigation efficiency and conservation of water 
 (iii)  Reduction of irrigation time and effort to manage the crop 
 (iv)  Uniform planting that helps achieve higher yield 
  (v)  Reduction of insect pests, weeds, and disease problems 
 (vi)  Cost reduction due to reduced input of seeds, fertilizer, fuels, and chemicals

   Some major limitations of laser leveling are (i) high cost of the equipment/laser  
instrument, (ii) need for skilled operator to set/adjust laser settings and operate the  
tractor, and (iii) more efficient for regularly sized and shaped field. 

11.5.1.1     Tillage Operations 

Tillage operations include puddling, bund preparation, and maintenance. It covers vari- 
ous practices ranging from zero or minimum tillage with minimum soil disturbance to  
a totally puddled soil where soil structure is destroyed. Tillage operations consist of  
different steps: (i) plowing to dig up (till), mix, and overturn the soil, (ii) breaking of  
soil clods and incorporation of plant residues through harrowing, and (iii) field level- 
ing. Initial land preparation should start immediately after previous harvest to effec- 
tively control weeds and to manage water inputs. Hydraulic conductivity, the capacity  
of the soil to conduct water downward and sideward of the soil, governs the seepage  
and percolation flows from a rice field (Bouman et al. 2007). When large and deep  
cracks are present in a field during soaking (before puddling), a significant amount of  
water can be lost as these cracks favor downward flow below the root zone. In order to  
reduce this loss, an additional shallow tillage before land soaking is recommended to  
close the cracks. A 100 mm reduction in water input was recorded by Cabangon and  
Tuong (2000) during wet land preparation through additional shallow tillage. 
   Thorough puddling of soil is helpful in reducing permeability and percolation rates;  
however, the efficacy of puddling largely depends on soil texture. For example, this  
practice is more efficient in clay soils compared with coarse soils as clay particles are  
negligible in a coarse-textured soil to migrate downward and fill the cracks. Puddling  
itself is a water-consuming process, and there is a trade-off between water consumed  
during puddling and water saved by reduced percolation rates. In a sandy topsoil with  
loamy subsoil (at least 5 %), use of heavy machinery for soil compaction is reported  
to reduce soil permeability (Harnpichitvitaya et al.  1999). It would be difficult for the  
small farmers to compact their soils due to a high cost involvement, and a larger-scale  
adoption of this technology could be feasible with government support. 
   To minimize water loss in form of seepage, bunds should be well compacted, and  
any cracks and rat holes should be sealed at the beginning of the crop growth period.  
Height of bund should be between 30 and 50 cm to avoid any over-bund flow during  
heavy rainfall. Small levees of 5–10 cm height in the bunds can be used to keep  
water up to 20 cm height (Bouman et al. 2007). Plastic sheets in bunds are also rec- 
ommended to reduce seepage loss, and a reduction of 450 mm of total water use in  
the rice field by lining the bunds with plastic has been reported (Bouman et al. 2005). 

11.5.1.2     Controlled Irrigation Through Field Channels 

Field channels are practically absent in many irrigation systems in Asia. Water flow  
from one field into the other usually occurs through breaches in the bunds (Bouman  
et al. 2007). This method has many disadvantages, for example, the amount of water  

----------------------- Page 267-----------------------

264                                                                                A. Datta et al. 

flow from a rice field cannot be controlled and it is not possible to practice field-  
specific water management. This suggests that farmers may not be able to com- 
pletely drain their fields before harvest as water keeps flowing inside the field from  
other fields. In addition, the downstream field may not receive water if farmers of  
upstream field retain water in their fields or let their fields dry out for harvesting.  
Continuous flow of water through the fields also causes removal of valuable nutri- 
ents from the fields. An improvement in the individual control of water could be  
possible by making separate field channels to convey water to and from each field  
with greater efficiency. 

11.5.2       Unproductive Water Outflow Reduction 

A considerable amount of water is lost both during land preparation and crop growth  
period through unproductive evaporation, seepage, and percolation flows (Bouman  
and Tuong 2001). It is essential to reduce these losses for increasing rice water pro- 
ductivity.  Unproductive  water  loss  can  be  minimized  through  various  measures  
including (i) reducing the duration of land preparation by minimizing the idle peri- 
ods, (ii) increasing the resistance of soil to water flow, and (iii) reducing the hydro- 
static pressure of water (Bouman and Tuong 2001). 

11.5.2.1     Reducing the Duration of Land Preparation by Minimizing  
            the Idle Periods 

“Idle periods” in rice production is the period that lies in between tillage operations  
and transplanting. In transplanted rice, seedlings are grown for 2–4 weeks in a seed- 
bed, and during this period, the fields surrounding the seedbed are tilled (land prepa- 
ration)  and  flooded  using  a  field-to-field  irrigation  system.  In  this  case,  a  huge  
amount of water is lost through unproductive flows. This land preparation period  
can  be  minimized  through  good  irrigation  practices  such  as  supplying  irrigation  
water  directly  to  seedlings  in  nurseries  without  submerging  the  main  fields  and  
development of irrigation system where farmers can irrigate their fields independent  
of the surrounding fields. Different countries have different practices for this pur- 
pose, for example, specific land areas are devoted to community seedbeds in China  
and Vietnam  that  can  be  irrigated  independently  (Tuong  and  Bouman  2003).  In  
Malaysia, about 375 mm water has been annually saved in two rice-cropping sea- 
sons under Muda Irrigation System where canal and drainage intensity has been  
increased from 10 to 30 m ha−1, resulting in a reduction in the duration of land  

preparation by 25 days (Abdullah  1998). Direct seeding rather than transplanting  
rice  seedling  is  another  way  to  reduce  the  “idle  periods”  of  land  preparation  
(Bhuiyan et al. 1995). However, the cropping duration of direct-seeded rice is more  
than  transplanting  rice;  hence,  more  water  is  utilized  during  this  long-growing  
season.

11.5.2.2       Increasing the Resistance of Soil to Water Flow 

Physical properties of soil such as texture, structure, and porosity are important fac- 
tors that may affect the water flow into the soil. Changing the physical properties of  
soil can offer more resistance to water flow and hence reduce water loss through  
evaporation, seepage, and percolation flows. In order to close the cracks in soil, an  
additional shallow tillage before land preparation is very effective (Cabangon and  
Tuong  2000). Thorough puddling of soil is helpful in reducing permeability and  
percolation rates. Soil compaction through heavy machinery has been proven effec- 
tive  in  decreasing  soil  permeability.  Different  types  of  physical  barriers  such  as  
plastic sheets underneath rice soils are also beneficial in reducing water loss through  
seepage and percolation; however, most of the physical barriers are cost-prohibitive  
and beyond the financial scope of the poor farmers (Tuong and Bouman 2003). 

11.5.2.3       Reducing the Hydrostatic Pressure of Water 

A reduction in hydrostatic pressure can be obtained by reducing seepage and perco- 
lation flows that result from a changed water management. Instead of keeping the  
rice field continuously under flooded conditions (5–10 cm of standing water), the  
floodwater depth can be minimized by keeping the soil around saturation or AWD  
regimes  can  be  imposed  (Tuong  and  Bouman  2003).  Soil  saturation  is  mostly  
attained by providing irrigation with about 1 cm water depth a day or so after the  
disappearance of standing water. 

11.5.3        Alternate Wetting and Drying (AWD)  

It is a technology developed by the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) and  
its  national  agricultural  research  and  extension  system  to  cope  with  increasing  
shortage of water for agricultural use, especially for rice. In AWD, irrigation water  
of about 2–5 cm is applied with an interval of 2–7 days followed by disappearance  
of ponded water from soil surface (Tuong and Bouman 2003). 
    Being a high water-demanding plant, a minor decrease in water demand by rice  
will help save a large volume of this precious natural resource. For this purpose,  
efforts have been made in the past several decades to increase rice water productiv- 
ity both from irrigation and rain by decreasing water use in rice production. One of  
such technologies is AWD where the field is not continuously flooded but the soil is  
allowed to dry out for one to several days after flooded water disappear and then  
flooded again (Lampayan et al. 2015). It is an efficient technology capable of reduc- 
ing water demand by as much as 38 % with no adverse impact on yield when prac- 
ticed  correctly  (Lampayan  et  al.  2015).  Proper  and  correct  implementation  also  
indirectly helps in increasing farmers’ income by reducing expenses of water pump- 
ing and fuel as observed in some Asian countries, for example, 17 % in southern

266                                                                                A. Datta et al. 

Vietnam, 32 % in the Philippines, and 38 % in Bangladesh (Lampayan et al. 2015).  
Adoption and implementation of this technology are very crucial for rice cultivation  
as only 30 % of agricultural land is occupied by irrigated rice, but water consump- 
tion  is  about  40  %  of  irrigated  water  (Dawe  2005).  Water  scarcity  will  affect  
15–25 m ha of rice lands of the main producing countries of South and Southeast  
Asia by 2025 (Tuong and Bouman 2003; Bouman et al. 2007). “Intermittent irriga- 
tion” developed in India was a first form of AWD. This technique is exceedingly  
becoming popular in East and Southeast Asian countries, but with different opera- 
tional methods with respect to timing, frequency of non-flooded period, and dura- 
tion depending on locality and environment (Lampayan et al.  2015). There were  
53–87 mm (13–16 %) savings in irrigation water in the AWD treatments compared  
with  the  continuously  submerged  regime.  However,  grain  yields  of  rice  (7.2– 
8.7 t ha−1) were not largely impacted by the water regimes. Water productivity was  

significantly lower in the continuously submerged regime compared with the AWD  
regime (Belder et al. 2004). 
    In some regions where scarcity of water is due to competition for water between  
agriculture and other sectors, for example, in some parts of China, a special type of  
AWD is practiced (Li and Barker 2004). In this specific practice of AWD, water of  
about 50–60 mm is applied with an interval of 6–8 days for heavy soils and with  
4–5 days interval for lighter soils. This follows a disappearance of water from soil  
surface  and  drying  of  soil  in  a  natural  process  until  the  next  irrigation  is  done.  
However, this method could not gain popularity among farmers possibly due to  
fear of yield loss and its complicated implementation guidelines. Another type of  
“safe” AWD was introduced by IRRI in 2002 with easy-to-use tools and simple  
guidelines to reduce irrigation water input without compromising yield. This prac- 
tice is recommended for many Asian countries including Vietnam (Rejesus et al.  
2014), the Philippines (Rejesus et al.  2011; Lampayan et al. 2015), Bangladesh  
(Price et al. 2013), and Myanmar (Lampayan et al. 2015). In these countries, this  
practice has been widely adopted, and the factors responsible for the success in the  
adoption of AWD could be used to successfully implement this technology in other  
parts of the world. Bouman et al. (2007) mentioned about three major stages of  
“safe” AWD: 

  (i)  Shallow flooding during the first 2 weeks after transplanting to help suppress  
      weeds and recover plants from transplant shock. 
 (ii)  Shallow ponding from heading to the end of flowering as this is a very critical  
      growth stage sensitive to water stress. During this stage, growth rate and water  
      requirement are also high. 
 (iii)  AWD during all other stages after flowering and water is provided only when  
      perched water table drops to 15 cm below the soil surface. It has been proved  
      that the threshold of 15 cm does not cause any yield loss as at this stage roots  
      system is strong enough to absorb water from zone below 15 cm. At 15 cm soil  
      depth, water potential is more than  −10 kPa that is the critical value for rice  
      and below which it starts showing symptoms of water-deficit stress (Bouman  
      and Tuong 2001).

11   Water Management in Rice                                                             267 

11.5.4       The System of Rice Intensification (SRI) 

The System of Rice Intensification (SRI) is a method of rice cultivation claimed  
to use less seed (under SRI the seed requirement is reduced by 80–90 %) and less  
water (water needs reduced by 25–50 %) and is reported to increase rice yields  
(by 30–100 %) of marginal farmers using traditional varieties without the appli- 
cation of agrochemical products (Stoop et al.  2002; Uphoff  1999, 2004, 2007).  
This method differs from conventional method of rice cultivation with respect to  
crop establishment, irrigation management, fertilizer application, and weed man- 
agement (Berkhout et al. 2015). SRI techniques are based on exploiting the inter- 
nal  genetic  potential  of  rice  plant  by  close  observation  of  the  physiological  
characteristics rather than depending on external inputs. Supporters of SRI con- 
sider  it  more  beneficial  for  poor  and  marginal  farmers  as  it  helps  increase  the  
grain yield by improving physiological efficiency in terms of increased root bio- 
mass, activity, longevity, and regulating available N status of rice plants without  
depending on costly seeds and expensive chemical fertilizers (Stoop et al. 2002;  
Uphoff  2007). The critics of this system do not agree with the claim of record- 
breaking  higher  yield,  and  they  note  that  the  SRI  approach  requires  intensive  
labor inputs, heavy use of organic inputs, and a high degree of water management  
(Surridge 2004; Latif et al. 2005; Senthilkumar et al. 2008). Despite many nega- 
tive  recommendations,  smallholders  in  many  countries  including  Cambodia,  
China, India, Indonesia, Myanmar, and Vietnam are reported to have adopted this  
method  (Kassam  et  al.  2011).  SRI  is  composed  of  5–6  major  cultivation  
practices: 

  (i)  Raising seedlings in a carefully managed nursery 
 (ii)  Early transplanting of 8–15-day-old seedlings (careful transplanting just after  
      uprooting in a shallow depth of 1–2 cm) 
 (iii)  Single transplant per hill in a square pattern with wider spacing (typically 25 ×  
      25 cm and possibly wider) of transplants 
 (iv)  Careful  water  management  to  promote  aerated  moist  conditions  of  the  soil  
      with a periodic dry spell of 3–6 days 
  (v)  Regular weeding through a rotary hoe to facilitate soil aeration 
 (vi)  The use of organic fertilizers in the form of farmyard manure, compost and  
      green manure (Stoop et al. 2002, 2009) 

   These practices are considerably different from conventional cultivation methods  
where 20–40-day-old seedlings are transplanted in closely spaced rows in clumps of  
two to four plants at a time and the fields are kept flooded for most of the growing  
season (transplanting to maturity). 
   Although these benefits are encouraging for resource-poor rice farmers to adopt  
the system, a detailed literature evaluating diffusion and adoption of this practice is  
limited. Most of the available literature dealing with SRI is focused on a localized  
scale. As a result, it is difficult to judge how widely the system is adopted world- 
wide. In addition, the factors shaping adoption patterns of this technique are also

inconsistent but substantially vary with location and season resulting in heteroge- 
neous productivity changes. 

11.5.5        Direct Seeding Method of Cultivation  

Direct seeding of rice (DSR) is a process of rice crop establishment from seeds  
directly  sown  in  the  field  rather  than  by  transplanting  seedlings  raised  from  the  
nurseries (Farooq et al. 2011a). There are three primary methods of DSR: 

  (i)  Dry seeding – this is the process in which dry seeds are directly sown into dry  
       soil. 
 (ii)  Wet seeding – sowing pre-germinated seeds on soil that is wet and puddled. 
 (iii)  Water seeding – sowing seeds in standing water. 

    In Southeast Asia, a major shift has been observed from the traditional trans- 
planting system (TPR) to DSR cultivation during recent years largely due to some  
major problems associated with TPR cultivation including high water input, high  
labor demand, and cost reducing the profit margin (Farooq et al. 2011a). The major  
reasons  of  the  shift  from TPR  to  DSR  include  (i)  increasing  water  scarcity  and  
decreasing availability of water for agriculture, (ii) labor shortage and increasing  
labor wages, (iii) crop intensification and recent developments in DSR production  
techniques, (iv) adverse effects of puddling on soil physical properties and the suc- 
ceeding non-rice crop, and (v) rising interest in conservation agriculture (Kumar  
and Ladha 2011). In Asia, about 50 % of total irrigation water is used for rice culti- 
vation, while on global scale, the value ranges from 34 to 43 % (Bouman et al.  
2007). 
    The selection of TPR or DSR is dependent upon various factors, for example,  
low wages and adequate water favor TPR, while high wages and water shortage  
favor DSR. In Southeast Asia, DSR is generally practiced in the dry season to ensure  
better water control, but like global trend, the share of this region in dry-season rice  
production is less than 25 %. The share of DSR in global production is only 23 %  
(Rao et al. 2007). Adapting DSR could be helpful in attaining optimal plant density  
along with high water productivity, specifically for the areas where water scarcity is  
the main issue. In TPR cultivation, nearly 1-month-old seedlings are transplanted  
into puddled and continuously flooded soil, which is reported to increase nutrient  
availability, especially Zn, P, and Fe, and suppress weeds (Singh et al. 2001). 
    In the present scenarios of water and labor crisis, DSR is a feasible alternative for  
rice cultivation system in the world in general and Asia in particular. However, there  
are some constraints of DSR method. The major issue associated with DSR method  
is weed infestation; however, less weed pressure is reported when both pre- and  
postemergence herbicides are applied (Mahajan et al. 2013). Farmers use different  
weed management strategies based on their convenience, but an integration of dif- 
ferent weed management strategies is required for effective weed management in  
DSR system. Precise land leveling is another important issue and is reported to be a

prerequisite for DSR. The precise land leveling can be performed using laser level- 
ers (Mahajan et al. 2013). The use of proper seeding depth is a basic requirement of  
DSR, and it depends on soil type and soil moisture levels (Mahajan et al.  2013).  
Poor performance of most of the popular cultivars is another limiting factor of DSR  
method. Short-duration cultivars perform better under DSR production system, and  
use of long-duration cultivars usually results in lower yield (Mahajan et al. 2013). 

11.5.6       Aerobic Rice System  

Aerobic  rice  production  is  a  system  of  growing  specifically  developed  input-  
responsive  varieties  (aerobic  varieties)  in  non-puddled,  non-saturated,  and  well-  
drained soils without ponded water (Bouman et al. 2007). This is fundamentally a  
different approach of rice cultivation in a system like other upland crops such as  
maize and wheat to reduce water inputs in rice. In case of low rainfall, irrigation is  
applied to bring soil moisture content to field capacity. This is done when soil mois- 
ture content drops to certain threshold level, for example, halfway between field  
capacity  and  wilting  point  (Doorenbos  and  Pruit  1984).  Loss  of  water  occurs  
through evapotranspiration, and irrigation water should compensate that loss. It is  
practically impossible to apply irrigation water only to the root zone. Some part of  
the applied irrigation water is lost through deep percolation and is not available for  
plant absorption. The field application efficiency mainly depends on the irrigation  
method, for example, the efficiency is about 60–70 % for flash or furrow type of  
surface  irrigation,  while  it  is  more  than  90  %  for  drip  and  sprinkle  irrigation  
(Lampayan and Bouman  2005). The water saving potential of rice cultivation as  
upland crop varies with soil types. The practice of this method can reduce unpro- 
ductive water loss from all types of soils, especially on soils with high seepage and  
percolation rates (Bouman and Tuong 2001). The method not only lowers seepage  
and percolation loss but also evaporation loss is reduced due to non-standing water  
layer. 
    This change from anaerobic to aerobic systems is not only important in relation  
to water saving but also has major impacts on weed management, diseases, soil  
organic matter, nutrient dynamics, and greenhouse gas emissions. One of the major  
issues associated with this shift is poor weed management as water has been tradi- 
tionally considered as the “cheapest weed control agent,” but this benefit might not  
be available anymore with the adoption of these water-saving technologies. Another  
issue is the poor performance of lowland varieties under aerobic conditions. For the  
development of such rice varieties, a study on the functional genomics of the plant  
is required to find out the genetic mechanism of plant and its adaptive capability to  
such stresses. 
    The practice of upland rice cultivation is common in some parts of the world and  
generally comprises of two major systems: as a low-input subsistence farming in  
Asia and as a high-input system commonly found in Brazil and some water-limited  
areas of China (Lafitte et al. 2002). Majority of farmers grow upland rice as a low-

270                                                                                 A. Datta et al. 

yielding subsistence crop to receive stable yields under the adverse upland condi- 
tions. Upland varieties are drought tolerant but are low yielding where water deficit,  
acid and infertile soils, weed competition, and diseases are the primary yield con- 
straints (Lafitte et al. 2002). On the other hand, some of the lowland varieties are  
cultivated under upland conditions with supplementary irrigation, but yield loss is  
significantly high (McCauley  1990). De Datta et al. (1973) conducted an experi- 
ment where a high-yielding lowland rice variety, IR20, was grown like an upland  
crop under furrow irrigation. They observed a total water savings of 56 % and irriga- 
tion water savings of 78 % compared with growing rice under flooded conditions,  
but  yield  was  reduced  from  7.9  to  3.4  t  ha−1.  Westcott  and  Vines  (1986)  and  

McCauley ( 1990) conducted studies in two states of the USA (Texas and Louisiana)  
on non-flooded irrigated rice (commercial varieties) using sprinkler irrigation under  
lowland conditions. A reduction of 20–50 % in irrigation water requirement was  
recorded compared with flooded conditions depending on types of soil, rainfall, and  
water management practices, but yield was reduced by 20–30 % compared with  
flooded conditions. 
    Ideally high-yielding varieties under upland conditions are required, and for this  
purpose, new “aerobic rice” varieties are essential that can combine characters of  
upland and lowland rice varieties, being high yielding like lowland varieties and  
drought tolerant like upland varieties (Atlin et al. 2006). Brazil and North China are  
among the pioneers of introducing such varieties. In Brazil, a yield of 5–7 t ha−1 is  

recorded  for  this  system  of  cultivation  under  sprinkler  irrigation,  and  about  
250,000 ha of land is used for cultivation of these varieties. In North China, flash  
irrigation system in bunded fields is used for these varieties with a yield of about  
6–7.5 t ha−1 (Lampayan and Bouman 2005). In China, these varieties are being cul- 

tivated on about 120,000 ha of land. 

11.5.7       Ground Cover Rice Production System (GCRPS) 

Ground cover rice production system (GCRPS) is an innovative production tech- 
nique  developed  to  use  less  water  and  to  improve  tolerance  to  low  temperature  
(Shen et al. 1997; Liu et al. 2013). This water-saving technology was first developed  
by the Agriculture Bureau of Shiyan region in China in 1990 (Shen et al.  1997). In  
this  system,  soil  surface  is  covered  with  a  5–7  μm  thick  plastic  film;  traditional  
lowland rice cultivars are used and grown at soil saturation point without any stand- 
ing  water  for  the  whole  crop  growth  period  (Qu  et  al.  2012).  This  technique  is  
reported to conserve water, preserve heat, and alleviate low temperature stress dur- 
ing early crop growing stage after transplanting, especially in water-deficit and cool  
hilly  areas  (Shen  et  al.  1997;  Qu  et  al.  2012).  It  also  helps  save  water  through  
increased WUE  by  reducing  evaporation  and  seepage.  It  has  been  reported  that  
WUE of GCRPS yielded up to 0.8–1.0 kg grain m−3 water (Tao et al. 2006) com- 
pared with WUE of 0.4 kg grain m−3 water with the traditional method of cultivation  

(Tuong et al. 2005). This technique is also environmental friendly as it helps reduce

rate of herbicidal application because plastic film prevents weed germination and  
development (Wu et al.  1999). 
   Despite the benefits of GCRPS, some disadvantages are also associated with the  
application of this technique as reported under different conditions (Tao et al. 2006;  
Qu et al. 2012). A reduction in grain yield compared with the traditional flooded  
system was reported for areas without any water scarcity and low temperature stress  
(Wu et al.  1999) as well as for sandy soils (Tao et al. 2006). However, this system  
was reported to provide superior yield compared with the traditional flooded system  
for areas where water is a limiting factor for crop growth and temperature is low  
during the early crop growth stage (Qu et al. 2012). A significant increase in yield  
in 22 sites out of the total 36 sites was observed by Liu et al. (2013) in central China  
where this technique was first developed. 
   GCRPS is basically an “aerobic rice” system that utilizes plastic mulching or  
straw mulching in the cultivation system. Plastic mulching with drip irrigation is a  
relatively new water-saving technology for rice cultivation (He et al. 2013). He et al.  
(2013) reported a yield reduction of 31.8–52.2 % under plastic mulching with drip  
irrigation compared with conventional flooding, which was primarily due to a low  
dry matter accumulation during post-anthesis. However, the WUE was the highest  
under plastic mulching with drip irrigation (1.5–2.1 times higher compared with  
conventional flooding cultivation system). Therefore, this method could be used as  
a better water-saving technology in areas of water scarcity with lower yield poten- 
tial (He et al. 2013). 

11.5.8      Genetic Approach 

Water productivity in rice production can be increased by suitable germplasm devel- 
opment (Tuong and Bouman 2003). The primary goal of plant breeding in the past  
several years has been to increase yield by reducing crop growth duration and to  
introduce good agronomic traits. Water productivity of the modern “IRRI varieties”  
with respect to total water inputs is almost three times higher compared with the  
water productivity of the traditional varieties. Rice varieties developed before the  
1980s are more efficient with high WPET as plant breeding program from the early  
1960s to early 1980s emphasizes on yield improvement by reducing growth dura- 
tion (Tuong  1999). Cultivars released after the mid-1980s have long growth dura- 
tion with comparatively less WPET. Tropical japonica rice varieties have 25–30 %  
higher photosynthesis to transpiration ratio than indica type indicating higher tran- 
spiration efficiency of tropical japonica varieties (Peng et al. 1998). 
   Improvement of genetic resistance to biotic (e.g., rice blast disease) and abiotic  
stresses (e.g., drought, salinity, submergence) is also important and effective breed- 
ing approach to water-saving rice cultivation systems. Plant breeders have been suc- 
cessful  in  manipulating  drought  escape  in  the  drought-prone  and  low-fertility  
rainfed environments. Reduction in growth duration and minimization of the risk of  
coincidence of crop sensitive growth stages with water-deficit periods have helped

272                                                                                 A. Datta et al. 

minimize  drought  exposure  (Tuong  and  Bouman  2003).  The  development  of  
drought-tolerant rice varieties has been slow mainly because of genetic complexity  
of the trait and its interaction with the environment (Tuong and Bouman 2003), and  
the unavailability of a specific method for screening the large number of genotypes  
required in breeding for drought (Zeigler and Puckridge  1995). However, drought-  
tolerant varieties are developed and released in upland and rainfed lowland areas  
(Tuong and Bouman  2003). Development of modern drought-screening facilities  
and  methods  is  helping  in  facilitating  the  process  of  understanding  drought-  
resistance  traits  and  in  selecting  drought-tolerant  genotypes  (O’Toole  2004).  In  
many rice-growing countries, salinity remains the most widespread soil problem,  
and salinity-tolerant varieties are needed for such environments where the cultiva- 
tion  of  conventional  lowland  varieties  is  not  possible.  One  of  the  examples  of  
salinity- tolerant rice varieties is Ir51500–AC11–1 (Tuong and Bouman 2003). 

11.6       Conclusions and Future Thrusts 

Water has been taken for granted for centuries in irrigated rice production under  
continuously  flooded  fields,  but  the  present  looming  water  crisis  stresses  for  a  
change in rice production system in the future. There is a renewed research interest  
on some of the traditional water-saving irrigation techniques that gained popularity  
in the 1970s such as AWD and saturated soil culture. Water-saving potentials of  
these technologies cannot be denied, but mostly associated with a yield penalty.  
Asia, the biggest rice producer and severely affected by water scarcity, needs more  
attention, and farmers in many Asian countries have already started adopting these  
technologies. For example, AWD is mostly adopted by farmers in China (Li 2001),  
North Central India, and Central Luzon, Philippines. 
    A modern concept of water-saving rice cultivation is aerobic rice system. The  
credit of this system goes to the farmers of northern China and is now commercially  
popular in Brazil. Water crisis is causing a shift of rice cultivation system from con- 
tinuously  anaerobic  to  alternate  aerobic–anaerobic  and  then  completely  aerobic  
conditions. For this purpose, a more advanced and effective rational engineering  
strategies are required for the development of rice cultivars with high water produc- 
tivity. Future research is needed to check the genetic improvement for drought toler- 
ance  in  rice  with  respect  to  crop  duration  and WUE.  An  integrated  approach  is  
required for gene expression to increase water productivity. Cross-fertilization of  
hardy wild rice species also needs attention from researchers. Similarly, a combina- 
tion of traditional breeding methods with genetic transgenic methods might be a  
better option. Site-specific studies are also required across the continents as a single  
strategy might not be acceptable worldwide. In future research, focus should also be  
given on crop nutrition, especially on micronutrients. Ecological monitoring of the  
new system is also essential and should not be ignored. Overall, different physiolog- 
ical and ecological tools should be explored to achieve maximum rice yield with  
minimum water use.

Chapter 12 
Insect Herbivores of Rice: Their Natural  
Regulation and Ecologically Based  
Management 

Finbarr G. Horgan 

12.1      Summary 

The management of insect herbivores in rice ecosystems has been strongly influ- 
enced by three poorly informed beliefs. These are (1) that insects have predomi- 
nantly negative effects on crop health, (2) that herbivore damage translates directly  
to yield loss, and (3) that insecticides are necessary to reduce losses due to insect  
herbivores’. In the face of global changes, particularly increases in the production  
and marketing of agrochemicals, these beliefs will lead to unsustainable rice pro- 
duction systems and poor environmental health. This chapter assesses these beliefs,  
challenges their validity, and (by analyzing the dynamics of herbivore populations  
and their interspecific interactions in the rice ecosystem) presents a holistic alterna- 
tive for understanding herbivore impacts on rice production systems. The chapter  
proposes a focus on “rice ecosystem health” with herbivore management based on  
ecological principals and incorporating such novel approaches as “ecological engi- 
neering” for ecosystem stability and system resilience. 

12.2      Introduction 

Rice paddies are among the most biologically diverse agricultural systems on the  
planet.  Patterns  of  productivity  in  irrigated  rice  are  dominated  by  flood  cycles.  
These cycles produce periodic shifts from dry to flooded conditions. Such shifts,

together with high primary productivity, promote a rich diversity of flora and fauna  
(Catling  1992; Way and Heong 1994; Settle et al. 1996; Horgan et al. 2017a). The  
biodiversity of rice fields, particularly flooded fields, contributes to the sustainabil- 
ity  and  resilience  of  the  system  through  several  regulatory  ecosystem  functions  
(Settle et al. 1996; Ings et al. 2009; Global Rice Science Partnership 2013). Because  
of the enormous land area under rice production globally (>160 m ha) (Global Rice  
Science Partnership 2013), it is imperative to manage rice landscapes recognizing  
and protecting all their ecosystem functions. Such ecosystem functions include the  
provisioning of food resources for humans, biodiversity maintenance and conserva- 
tion, prevention of soil erosion and flooding, and the protection of water resources  
and soil health (Global Rice Science Partnership 2013). 
   The arthropods that inhabit rice fields provide a range of essential ecosystem  
services. A relatively small number of arthropod herbivores damage rice plants (see  
below); however, the vast majority of arthropods species are beneficial. These recy- 
cle  organic  materials  through  decomposition,  act  as  natural  enemies  that  reduce  
herbivore damage, pollinate wildflowers and crops, or reduce weed populations by  
attacking weed foliage and seeds (Way and Heong 1994; Settle et al. 1996; Schmidt  
et al. 2015; Westphal et al. 2015). Rice fields, particularly in the tropics, often have  
a higher diversity of arthropod natural enemies than herbivore species, resulting in  
rice food webs that are understandably complex (Cohen et al.  1994; Wilby et al.  
2006). High complexity in food web interactions is predicted to increase the stabil- 
ity and resilience of rice ecosystems (Ings et al. 2009). Furthermore, by responding  
to changing herbivore densities at spatial and temporal scales, several arthropods in  
the rice community are recognized as important regulators of herbivore populations  
(Sawada et al. 1993; De Kraker et al. 1999a, b; Wagiman et al. 2014). Therefore, any  
discussion about the arthropod herbivores of rice would be incomplete without a  
broader focus on their interactions with other components of the rice ecosystem,  
particularly their natural enemies. 
   Rice has a complex crop cycle that includes a period with low amounts of living  
biomass (after plowing and puddling), followed by a sudden and rapid accumulation  
of rice and weed biomass after transplanting or direct seeding. A diversity of insect  
natural enemies with distinct habitat requirements, behaviors, and diets are required  
to maintain herbivores at low population densities (Settle et al.  1996; Wilby et al.  
2006; Gurr et al. 2012). For example, early in the rice crop, when much of the bio- 
mass is nonliving and invertebrate decomposers are abundant, generalist natural ene- 
mies can invade the rice fields and build up numbers – these become the first line of  
defense against rice pests that arrive to the fields after transplanting or sowing (Settle  
et al. 1996). As the rice plants grow and develop, herbivores will invade the rice fields,  
a small number of these can become rice pests if not effectively regulated; however,  
generalist predators consume many of these early herbivore colonists. At the same  
time, specialist natural enemies like egg parasitoids (Hymenoptera) and mirid preda- 
tors (Homoptera: Miridae) begin to colonize the fields and build up numbers (Kenmore  
et al.  1984; Settle et al. 1996). These specialists are essential to maintain low herbi- 
vore  numbers  throughout  the  cropping  period  but  are  vulnerable  to  perturbations,  
particularly during early crop stages. For this reason, it is strongly  recommended to

promote natural enemy abundance during the early crop by  creating suitable habitat  
(i.e., ecological engineering) and avoiding pesticides (Settle et al.  1996; Gurr et al.  
2012). It is important to note that rice attacked by herbivores at early crop stages can  
often compensate well for damage and suffers no yield reductions (Rubia et al. 1996a;  
Horgan et al.  2016a) or in some cases over compensates for low levels of damage  
leading to higher yields (Nik Mohammad Noor et al.  1995; Islam and Karim 1997). 
   Knowledge of the complexity of the rice ecosystem has increased after several  
years of detailed studies, particularly during the 1990s – however, the predominant  
paradigms in rice crop management often overlook this knowledge, or fail to apply  
it, and can sometimes lead to devastating consequences for rice farmers. Three pre- 
dominant beliefs or attitudes expressed by rice farmers and agricultural extension  
workers have been that (1) “insects”(implying “all” or “most” insects in the rice  
field) consume and damage rice, that (2) the damage they cause is proportional or  
correlated to yield loss, and that (3) insecticides are an efficient means of reducing  
that damage, protecting the crop and increasing yield (Litsinger et al.  1987; Heong  
et al.  1995; Rubia et al. 1996b; Heong and Escalada 1999). However, the reality is  
much  more  complex. This  chapter  examines  these  common  beliefs  and  presents  
some new ideas that are generally good news for farmers and that should promote  
more sustainable and environmentally friendly rice production. 

12.3      Addressing Common Beliefs About Insects in Rice  
         Fields 

12.3.1      Assessing     the Belief that Most Insects Are “Bad” 

It  is  a  common  concern  among  researchers  working  in  “pest”  management  that  
farmers fail to differentiate “good insects” from “bad insects” and generally have  
little understanding of the effectiveness of the “good insects” in managing the “bad”  
(International Rice Research Institute 1993; Lazaro and Heong 1995). Often, farm- 
ers that note one or two insects (individuals) attacking a rice plant will exaggerate  
the potential risk when extrapolating to field scales. A single caterpillar feeding on  
a plant or a small amount of apparent damage is often enough to precipitate a round  
of  insecticide  spraying  (Rubia  et  al.  1996b;  Bandong  et  al.  2002;  Escalada  and  
Heong  2004). Lazaro et al. (1993) found that farmers grossly overestimate yield  
losses from stemborers (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) and often attributed yield losses  
from other factors (lack of fertilizer, late planting, etc.) to insect damage. Farmers  
who have poorly managed their fields, resulting in high densities of some apparent  
pest (such as planthoppers [Homoptera: Delphacidae]), will often cause their neigh- 
bors to unnecessarily spray their own fields in the mistaken belief that pest insects  
will move from a sprayed field to any adjacent unsprayed field (Litsinger et al. 1987;  
Rubia et al.  1996b). Unfortunately, pesticide vendors will often capitalize on the  
farmer’s inability to accurately or objectively assess risks from insect herbivores to

his/her  rice  crop  by  prescribing  pesticide  applications  (Escalada  et  al.  2009;  
Thorburn  2015).  Farmers’  field  schools  and  targeted  education  campaigns  have  
gone a long way in improving the situation among farmers. For example, Indonesia’s  
National Integrated Pest Management Program and the Farmer Field Schools of the  
Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) were apparently  
successful in reducing insecticide use in the 1990s (Matteson 2000; Thorburn 2015).  
These schools aimed to train farmers to recognize the beneficial roles of predatory  
insects; however, such education campaigns have variable impacts in reducing pes- 
ticide applications (Lazaro and Heong  1995), suffer from a lack of continuity (due  
to poor funding), and suffer from aggressive product advertising by agrochemical  
companies (Escalada et al. 2009; Thorburn 2015), who sometimes become a part of  
pest management training (Ferroni and Zhou 2012). 

12.3.1.1     Contrasting Dynamics of Herbivore Populations 

Approximately 800 insect herbivores have been noted to feed on rice, but only about  
20 are considered economically damaging (Kiritani  1979; Pathak and Khan 1994).  
Many are problematic due to their peculiar population dynamics, that is, they rarely  
cause  problems  at  endemic  levels,  but  can  lead  to  major  yield  losses  when  they  
attain outbreak densities. Some of the characteristics of outbreak species can be  
summarized as follows: 

 1.  Many  outbreak  species,  such  as  planthoppers  and  leaf  folders  (Lepidoptera:  
    Pyralidae),  are  migratory.  For  example,  the  brown  planthopper,  Nilaparvata  
    lugens  (Stål),  and  rice  leaf  folder,  Cnaphalocrocis  medinalis  (Guenée),  make  
    springtime migrations northward from tropical Southeast Asia to northern China,  
    Korea, and Japan with generally smaller migrations southward during the autumn  
    (Riley et al.  1995; Otuka et al. 2010). The rapid and massive concentration of  
    individuals carried on air currents may result in large and sudden increases in  
    abundance that overwhelm natural enemies and lead to severe damage (Otuka  
    et al. 2010). Evidence suggests that this has occurred in rice fields of Northeast  
   Asia for centuries and prior to modern rice cultivation methods (Miyashita 1963;  
   Litsinger et al.  1987). 
 2.  Many outbreak species are tolerant to high levels of intraspecific crowding and  
   have an aggregated distribution in rice fields compared to non-outbreak species;  
    for   example,   planthoppers   aggregate   more   than   leafhoppers   (Homoptera:  
    Cicadellidae), whereas stemborers and leaf folders have largely random distribu- 
   tions  (Kuno  and  Hokyo  1970;  Ôtake  1976;  Iwao  1979).  Aggregation  often  
    improves  conspecific  fitness  and  may  promote  rapid  population  increases  at  
    early colonizer generations (Horgan et al. 2016b). 
 3.  Outbreak species are often typical r-strategists that have a high reproductive out- 
   put but consequent low defensive or competitive ability – making them vulner- 
    able   to   natural   enemies   (Southwood   et   al.   1974).  Among   planthoppers,  
   physiological  responses  to  plant  age  and  conspecific  density  can  also  lead  to

12   Insect Herbivores of Rice                                                            283 

    rapid  population  increases  at  early  stages  of  colonization  (Padgham  1983).  
    Population  density  can  also  determine  whether  an  individual  is  macropterous  
    (having greater dispersal capacity) or brachypterous (having higher fecundity)  
    and thereby ensures maximum planthopper fitness on the developing rice plant. 
 4.  A number of herbivore species that reach outbreak densities are recognized as  
    invasive. These are species that have spread to new regions where they benefit  
    from reduced interspecific competition or predation. Noted examples include the  
    rice water weevil, Lissorhoptrus oryzophilus Kuschel; sorghum stemborer, Chilo  
   partellus (Swinhoe) (Pathak and Khan 1994); Mexican sugarcane borer, Eoreuma  
    loftini (Dyar) (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) (Hunnel et al. 2010; Wilson et al. 2015);  
    and rice grain bug, Paromius nr. longulus Dall. (Homoptera: Lygaeidae; recently  
    discovered in the Philippines – Orboc personal communication). Some of these  
    species   are   not   typical   r-strategists.   For   example,   invasive   black   bugs,  
    Scotinophara spp. (Homoptera: Pentatomidae), have become more problematic  
    in the Philippines in recent decades but have a relatively low fecundity and are  
    nonmigratory (Joshi et al.  2007). However, they often occur in large aggrega- 
    tions which may be the result of attraction toward village street lights or due to  
    habitat change (personal observations). 

   Some  insect  herbivores  cause  economic  losses  to  rice  farmers  even  at  low  
 densities – this is often because they transmit harmful viruses, such as the Nephotettix  
spp.  (Homoptera:  Cicadellidae)  that  transmit  tungro  virus  in  Southeast  Asia  or  
Tagosodes  orizicolus  (Muir)  (Homoptera:  Delphacidae)  that  transmits  Rice  hoja  
blanca virus (RHBV) in Central America and the Caribbean (Fujita et al.  2013).  
Furthermore,   some   insect   herbivores,   such   as   rice   bugs,   Leptocorisa   spp.  
(Homoptera: Alydidae), are problematic because they damage the rice grains either  
directly reducing yield at a late stage in the crop or reducing the quality of the seed  
and thereby its market value (Jahn et al. 2004). These species are often polyphagous  
and  habitat  generalists  and,  in  contrast  to  the  outbreak  species  discussed  above,  
often attain higher population densities in relatively heterogeneous habitats (Pathak  
and Khan 1994). 

12.3.1.2     Regulation of Herbivore Densities 

Without  natural  enemies,  population  densities  of  any  herbivore  species  would  
increase exponentially, and rice cultivation would be impossible. Among the studies  
that have examined regulation of rice herbivores, there have been two schools with  
rather  different  emphases.  Early  studies,  predominantly  from  Japan,  focused  on  
intrinsic rates of natural increase and found density dependent reductions in egg  
laying and population growth as important regulating factors. This density depen- 
dence was often attributed to intraspecific competition with little role attributed to  
natural enemies (Miyashita  1963; Kuno and Hokyo 1970). Studies in tropical rice,  
particularly from Indonesia and the Philippines, focused more on the role of natural  
enemies. These studies often found strong correlations between the abundance of

planthopper and spiders, egg parasitoids, or mirid bugs (Fig.  12.1). These observa- 
tions suggested density-dependent responses. Kenmore et al. (Kenmore et al.  1984)  
pointed out that spiderling recruitment was highest when prey density was high –  
suggesting numerical responses to density that were likely to be delayed; but some  
species,  like  Cyrtorhinus  lividipennis  Reuter  (Hemiptera:  Miridae),  responded  
numerically through aggregation to areas of high herbivore densities (Sawada et al.  
1993; Way and Heong 1994). Density dependence is a feature of regulation and an  
indicator of a healthy rice environment. 
    Regulatory natural enemies are often not the principal mortality factors impact- 
ing  herbivore  populations;  mortality  due  to  key  factors  (the  main  source  of  
 mortality – or main life stage affected by mortality) is often density independent and  
may be determined by factors such as climate, poor synchronization of some insect  
life stage with the crop, or generalist predators. For example, the key factor in the

dynamics of stemborer populations in deepwater rice is neonate mortality between  
the time of egg hatch and before the larva enters the rice stem (Islam  1994). During  
this phase, natural enemies cause high mortality to neonates searching for suitable  
feeding sites. Herbivore populations in rice are therefore affected by multi-tier sys- 
tems that may include key factors such as generalist natural enemies that reduce  
high herbivore densities to lower equilibrium points and regulators that maintain the  
populations at this lower equilibrium density.

            Insect Damage 

12.3.2.1     Difficulties in Measuring Yield Losses Due to Herbivores 

Rice damage, rice plant responses to damage, and yield losses due to damage are all  
features of the interactions between herbivores and the rice plant. Therefore, to ade- 
quately define damage and yield losses due to herbivores, researchers must account  
for a range of possible responses by rice plants, some of which are specific to certain  
rice varieties or to particular cultivation systems. Thousands of rice varieties are cur- 
rently used in modern agriculture, and most of these are genetically, anatomically,  
and physiologically different and, hence, respond differently to herbivore damage.  
For example, some varieties are highly tolerant to damage such that even severe insect  
damage causes no yield decline (Horgan and Crisol 2013; Horgan et al. 2016a). In  
some cases, certain insects may actually cause overcompensation, with higher yields  
after damage (Nik Mohammad Noor et al. 1995; Rubia et al. 1996a; Islam and Karim  
1997), whereas other varieties may be highly susceptible to herbivores, e.g., Taichung  
Native 1 (De Datta  1981). Many studies that have attempted to assess yield losses to  
herbivores have used only the most susceptible varieties (De Datta  1981). Although  
fraught with methodological problems, several studies do give some reasonable indi- 
cation of the potential effects of herbivores on rice yield. However, the following  
cautions should be taken into account before considering the results of such studies: 

 1.  Whereas scientists have normally focused on a single herbivore species and its  
    effects on a specific rice variety (or at most a small group of varieties), rice plants  
    in the field interact with a complex of herbivores. It is clear that damage from  
    different herbivores is not additive. Different herbivore species, even from the  
    same feeding guilds, have different effects on rice plants (Horgan et al. 2016a).  
    Furthermore, plant-mediated interactions between herbivores or between herbi- 
    vores and diseases can reduce the negative effects of one or other pest or disease  
    in a way that is ultimately beneficial to the plant (Pangga et al.  1993; Kanno and  
    Fujita 2003). 
 2.  In order to estimate herbivore effects on yield, researchers have often used meth- 
    ods  that  do  not  adequately  represent  field  situations.  In  greenhouse  and  pot  
    experiments, apart from a lack of natural enemies that would normally limit the

286                                                                                F.G. Horgan 

    buildup of pests, the herbivores themselves often find optimal conditions (i.e.,  
    controlled temperatures) or are adapted to captivity because they have been labo- 
    ratory reared for multiple generations. Furthermore, plants in pots are not repre- 
    sentative of field-grown plants because they often experience root competition in  
    confined spaces (Crisol et al. 2013). 
 3.  Estimates of herbivore damage are often too general: Early reports gave blanket  
    estimates of about 30 % without considering spatial or temporal variability in  
    population densities (Litsinger et al.  1987). For example, it is quite likely that N.  
    lugens causes 100 % yield losses in some areas during some outbreaks, but at  
    endemic (chronic) densities, they may cause zero losses or even an increase in  
    yields. Since outbreaks are atypical events and are often the result of poor crop  
    management – such losses should not be taken into account when reporting “typ- 
    ical” herbivore-related yield losses. 
 4.  In considering arthropod effects on yields, studies have been biased toward her- 
    bivores. This may seem logical, but only a few studies have quantified in eco- 
    nomic terms (as related to yield) the benefits of invertebrate decomposers or the  
    role of pollinators in increasing farm productivity (Settle et al.  1996; Gurr et al.  
    2016). In recent years, these economic advantages have been given more atten- 
    tion  and  are  differentiated  from  yield  losses  as  ecosystem  services  (Schmidt  
    et  al.  2015;  Westphal  et  al.  2015).  However,  researchers  have  not  generally  
    looked at herbivory together with other ecosystem services – which should pro- 
    mote more balanced views and impart further knowledge in support of herbivore  
    management decisions. Some beneficial insects have been implicated in damag- 
    ing rice, for example, the lady beetle Micraspis crocea (Mulsant)(Coleoptera:  
    Coccinellidae) and the cricket Metioche vittaticollis (Stål)(Orthoptera: Gryllidae)  
    are efficient predators of rice herbivores, but these also consume rice pollen and  
    leaf tissues (Wilby et al. 2005). This sometimes causes farmers and researchers  
    to   mistakenly   regard   these   as   pests   (Pathak   and   Khan     1994,   personal  
    observation). 

12.3.2.2     Estimates of Herbivore-Related Yield Losses 

Early estimates of insect damage appear quite variable and often remarkably high,  
e.g., Grist and Lever ( 1969) indicated rice yield losses from insect herbivores in the  
1960s to be 18–36 % in Asia, but only 2–3.5 % in Latin America. Walker (1987)  
reviewed estimates of herbivore damage to rice during 1970–1983: National and  
regional  losses  ranged  from  4  to  45  %;  losses  to  planthoppers  in  South  and  
Southeast Asia ranged from 1 to 40 %; and losses by stemborers in Asia ranged  
from 1 to 40 %, whereas in Africa stemborers were estimated to cause 9–23 %  
yield  losses.  The  rice  gall  midge,  Orseolia  oryzae  (Wood-Mason)  (Diptera:  
Cecidomyiidae), in Asia was estimated to cause yield losses of 6–70 %! It is inter- 
esting to note that losses due to leaf folders in India were estimated at 10–18 % in  
the study, but recently, it has become widely accepted that leaf folders cause negli- 
gible  or  zero  yield  losses  (Matteson  2000).  It  is  likely  that  most  of  the  higher

12   Insect Herbivores of Rice                                                               287 

estimates   reported   above   concerned   atypical   outbreaks,   which   often   attract  
researcher attention and result in a bias toward higher estimates. The usual method  
to assess yield losses in many early reports has been to correlate insect damage and  
yield,  using  individual  rice  plants,  field  plots,  or  fields  as  sampling  units  (i.e.,  
Katanyukul 1982). Such opportunistic studies are subject to unrepresentative sam- 
pling, poor control of plant or plot management, and errors of “cause and effect.”  
Although such studies may guide future research, they are not recommended as a  
means of gaining concrete data. Furthermore, many older estimates of yield losses  
from insects can now be deemed unrealistic for modern farms because of changing  
preferences for rice varieties over the last several decades as well as an emphasis  
on host plant resistance during national and international rice breeding programs  
(Pathak and Khan 1994; Fujita et al. 2013). Hybrid rice varieties may be a notable  
exception: Many hybrid rice varieties are highly vulnerable to insect herbivores but  
are still grown by millions of farmers worldwide (Cheng 2009; Horgan and Crisol  
2013). 
    Several authors have reported the results of experimental studies that examined  
the effects of herbivore density on yield losses in rice. Because of the high diversity  
of insect herbivores and rice varieties used in such experiments, the results cannot  
be adequately addressed in the present chapter. However, the overall trends from  
such studies can be largely divided into four categories: 

 1.  No relation between herbivore densities and yield (no effect) or relatively minor  
    declines  in  yield  at  high  –  but  unrealistic  –  densities  (e.g.,  whorl  maggot  
    (International Rice Research Institute  1988), caseworm, Nymphula depunctalis  
    Guenée (Heinrichs and Viajante 1987), rice bug, Leptocorisa oratorius (F.) (Van  
    Den Berg and Soehardi 2000)) 
 2.  Clear correlations between insect density and yield loss, but with often unrealis- 
    tically high densities that would exaggerate yield losses if the results were pro- 
   jected to rice fields (e.g., rice hispa,  Dicladispa armigera Olivier (Coleoptera:  
    Chrysomelidae) (Chatterjee and Bera  1990); African gall midge,  Orseolia ory- 
    zivora Harris (Nacro et al.  1996); L. oratorius (Morrill et al.  1989)) 
 3.  Clear correlations between insect density and yield loss with realistic densities  
    because the herbivore species in question is prone to outbreaks (e.g., Scotinophara  
    sp.   (International   Rice   Research   Institute   1988),   N.   lugens   (Sarma   and  
    ChannaBasavanna 1980), L. oryzophilus (Zou et al. 2004)) 
 4.  Correlations between insect density and yield loss at relatively low to moderate  
    densities, indicating that the herbivore may cause yield losses at typical field  
    densities (e.g., stemborers (Bandong and Litsinger 2005)) 

    Often the results from different studies that assessed yield losses due to the same  
herbivore species provide conflicting results (i.e., Morrill et al.  1989; Van Den Berg  
and Soehardi 2000); this may reflect the different methods or different host plants  
used  in  the  evaluations.  Further  studies  of  yield  losses  that  incorporate  multiple  
plant types (i.e., rice hybrids, pure-line varieties, or traditional varieties) are still  
required to accurately define economic thresholds for future management programs  
aimed at particular herbivore species.

    Studies  that  compare  protected  and  control  plots  (called  the  “insecticide  check  
method”) are useful to estimate yield losses because they give estimates of damage  
from the complete herbivore community under field situations. The insecticide check  
method uses heavy insecticide applications, including mixing insecticides with the  
soil, in an attempt to eliminate herbivores from field plots – these are then compared  
to adjacent control plots that have received no insecticide applications. Some weak- 
nesses of the system include phytotoxic and phytotonic effects of the insecticides,  
effects of plot size, and the effects of pesticide drift on control plots and especially on  
natural enemies (Litsinger et al. 1987). Using this method, Litsinger et al. (1987) pre- 
sented estimates from the Philippines of insect-related crop losses that ranged from  
2 % in traditional dryland crops (yield 2.9 t ha−1) to 23 % in modern dryland crops  
(yield 4.2 t ha−1) and about 18 % in both traditional (yield 2.2 t ha−1) and modern  
rainfed crops (yield 3.9 6 t ha−1). Variability between sites was large, with the effects  

of herbivores ranging from −8 to 69 % yield declines (−8 implying a yield increase).  
Interestingly, the ranges of grain weight (grain biomass) lost or gained were much  
more consistent than percentage losses. Gains from insects (potential overcompensa- 
tion)  ranged  from  0.04  to  0.3  t  ha−1,  and  losses  from  insects  ranged  from  0.1  to  
2.4 t ha−1 or about 0.5 t ha−1 in the rainfed systems. In a similar study conducted over  

13 years at four irrigated, double-cropping sites, yield losses were estimated to be  
about 12 %, i.e., grain weight reduction of 0.6 t ha−1(Litsinger et al. 2005). 

    Recent estimates of rice crop losses due to insects have not been as rigorous or  
as frequent as those conducted in the 1980s to1990s. Considering modern varieties  
with higher yields, better crop management techniques including nutrient manage- 
ment, and a likely maximum loss of about 0.5 t ha−1 due to chronic pests, it should  

be expected that the percentage losses in yield would now be considerably lower  
than in the 1960s (Grist and Lever  1969), 1970s (Walker  1987) or 1980s (Litsinger  
et al.  1987, 2005). Until further estimates are available, losses due to herbivores in  
unmanaged rice fields should be regarded as spatially and temporally variable and  
likely  to  be  below  the  economic  thresholds  for  insecticide  use  at  field  or  larger  
scales.  Certainly,  based  on  the  current  understanding  of  herbivore-related  yield  
losses,  and  considering  the  capacity  of  rice  plants  to  compensate  for  damage,  it  
would be hard to justify any prophylactic insecticide use in modern rice farms. 

12.3.3      Assessing       the Belief that Insecticides Reduce Yield  
            Losses 

A third predominant belief among farmers and extension workers is that insecti- 
cides reduce damage and prevent yield losses. This belief has led to a multibillion  
dollar industry and to a fear among many farmers (known as fear aversion) that rice  
cannot yield without insecticides (Litsinger et al.  1987; Heong et al.  1994, 2002).  
The economic value of farmer “fear aversion” is clear (Fig.  12.2). In order to better

understand the issues related to insecticide use and its effects on rice, some points  
should be considered: 

 1.  Insecticides are toxic and rice plants are living organisms; therefore, the insecti- 
     cides also affect the plants. For example, studies using a range of insecticides  
     and spraying at different times and at different intensities have indicated that late  
     spraying can directly reduce rice yields (Peñalver 2014). 
 2.  Insecticides will often miss their target pests because of poor timing or because  
     the target is hidden in the stem, located at the base of the plant, or at a life stage  
     that is not affected by the chemical. Insecticides are often not applied properly  
     because  of  mixing  of  chemicals  or  poor  access  to  efficient  spray  equipment  
     (Heong et al. 2015). Also, because of the rapid development of herbivore resis- 
     tance   to   insecticides,   many   chemical   products   have   a   short   utility   time  
     (Matsumura et al. 2008); however, because products are not removed from mar- 
     kets, they continue to be used without effect.

 3.  Insecticides  can  cause  physiological  resurgence,  that  is,  the  target  herbivore  
    responds to the insecticide by increasing feeding, reproduction, or population  
    growth.  This  has  now  been  well  documented  for  planthoppers  (Azzam  et  al.  
    2009, 2011) and is becoming increasingly clear for stemborers and leaf folders  
    (Wang et al. 2005; Yu et al. 2007; Horgan et al. 2017b). 
 4.  Insecticides are indiscriminate; they usually kill or damage all insects including  
    the beneficial natural enemies of herbivores. Some insecticides are less toxic to  
    natural enemies than to herbivores, but even when natural enemies survive, or  
    where they rapidly recolonize insecticide-treated fields, their efficiency in preda- 
    tion may be reduced (Horgan et al. 2017b). These effects of insecticides on natu- 
    ral enemies can lead to ecological resurgence. Ecological resurgence has been  
    well documented for planthoppers (Kenmore et al.  1984). 
 5.  In some cases, applying insecticides to combat one pest will cause resurgence of  
    a second pest – such is the case with planthopper outbreaks which develop after  
    insecticide  applications  made  to  control  leaf  folders  (Ooi  and  Saleh  1979).  
    Interestingly, herbicides, fungicides, and molluscicides have also been noted to  
    increase herbivore damage to rice (Azzam et al. 2009, 2011; Horgan et al. 2014). 
 6.  Apart from the negative effects on rice ecosystem function and potential negative  
    effects on yield, pesticides also have negative effects on human health and on  
    livestock and wildlife (Pingali and Roger  1995). 

   Despite these obvious caveats and the need for caution, the pesticide industry  
has expanded: Asian farmers can now choose from thousands of insecticide prod- 
ucts (Litsinger et al.  1987; Heong et al. 1994; Heong and Escalada 1999). Figure  
12.2 indicates insecticide imports and exports in Asia over 50 years. It is apparent  
that  since  the  year  2000,  insecticide  purchases  have  increased  dramatically  in  
South  and  Southeast  Asian  countries.  Similar  trends  have  been  noted  in  Latin  
America  and  West  Africa  (Food  and  Agriculture  Organization  of  the  United  
Nations). Interestingly, the dramatic increases in pesticide imports into South and  
Southeast Asia began at about the time that China and India turned from being net  
importers to major exporters of insecticides (Food and Agriculture Organization of  
the  United  Nations).  Despite  the  massive  increases  in  insecticide  availability  in  
Asia, there has been no proportionate increase in national rice yields (Food and  
Agriculture Organization of the United Nations). Furthermore, outbreaks of resur- 
gence pests such as planthoppers have become increasingly common during the  
last 10–15 years (Cheng 2009; Fig. 12.3). Heong et al. (2015) have indicated from  
their results of over 3800 farmer interviews in Vietnam that rice yields have gener- 
ally  remained  constant  despite  farmers  applying  insecticides  between  0  and  >8  
times per crop. Judging from recent literature, it is possible that insecticides have  
become the principal drivers of rice herbivore outbreaks in Asia and are inadver- 
tently the major cause of insect-mediated yield losses when viewed at larger spatial  
and temporal scales.

12.4.1        The Rice Plant at the Center 

The rice plant is central to the functioning and dynamics of the rice ecosystem. Rice  
varieties  are  generally  categorized  between  susceptibility  and  resistance  based  on  
responses by key herbivores or diseases to the plants (Horgan  2012). Farmers are  
expected to base their choice of varieties on levels of known resistance. However, this  
seems to be rarely the case. For example, several reports have indicated that hybrid  
rice varieties are associated with high levels of damage from planthoppers and stem- 
borers throughout Asia. Despite such apparent susceptibility to damage, hybrid rice  
varieties have been increasingly adopted by Asian farmers and are the main rice vari- 
eties grown in China and northern Vietnam (Horgan and Crisol 2013). Nevertheless,

researchers continue to focus on the development of rice varieties with resistance to  
important  insect  herbivores  and  diseases  (Chen  et  al.  2012;  Fujita  et  al. 2013). A  
recent appraisal of rice pest management literature (Horgan 2012) indicates host plant  
resistance as the main focus of public research for the last several decades followed  
closely by research on potential insecticides (Horgan 2012). Furthermore, since the  
1990s, research in rice stemborers has been dominated by transgenic approaches to  
resistance with almost no research into “native” resistance sources (Horgan  2012).  
Whereas transgenic resistance holds some promise, transgenic resistant rice is not  
currently  available  to  rice  farmers  because  of  logistics  around  the  distribution  of  
transgenic varieties, a lack of confidence among farmers and consumers, and difficul- 
ties in managing the development of adapted herbivore populations (Teetes  1994;  
Horgan  2012).  More  recently,  some  reassessment  of  native  host  plant  resistance  
against rice stemborers has been reinitiated (Way et al. 2006; Hamm et al. 2012). 
    The  development  of  resistant  rice  varieties  using  conventional  breeding  tech- 
niques has been more successful against herbivores that have intimate associations  
with their host plant. These are usually monophagous species, such as planthoppers  
or gall midges, that can regulate plant hormones or sequester plant defenses to allow  
feeding or gall formation (Bentur et al. 2008; Fujita et al. 2013). Currently over 85  
genes have been identified imparting resistance against planthoppers and leafhoppers  
(Fujita et al. 2013; Horgan et al. 2015). Many of these genes have come from wild  
rice species, but several are from traditional rice varieties from Bangladesh, India,  
and Sri Lanka (Fujita et al. 2013). Planthoppers and leafhoppers feed less, gain less  
weight, develop slowly, and lay fewer eggs on varieties that carry resistance genes.  
However, the mechanisms underlying these responses have not generally been eluci- 
dated (Horgan 2009). Rice gall midge resistance is better understood and appears to  
be governed by gene-for-gene relationships akin to disease resistance. About 14 gall  
midge resistance genes have been identified, and these have been incorporated into  
several resistant rice varieties (Bentur et al. 2008). However, insect herbivores can  
often quickly adapt to resistant varieties (Peñalver Cruz et al. 2011; Ferrater et al.  
2013, 2015; Vu et al. 2014), and recent studies have indicated a gradual loss of resis- 
tance  against  field  populations  of  target  herbivores,  e.g.,  O.  oryzae  (Bentur  et  al.  
2008) and N. lugens (Horgan et al. 2015; Srinivasan et al. 2015). Clearly, host plant  
resistance  is  limited  by  the  emergence  of  virulent  herbivore  populations;  hence,  
effective resistance needs to be conserved through careful resistance management.  
This includes the limited deployment of resistance genes in time and space, careful  
crop management to avoid compromising resistance (Peñalver 2014), and attention  
to the preservation of natural enemies, some of which may be more effective in kill- 
ing herbivores on resistant plants (Kartohardjono and Heinrichs 1984; Horgan 2012). 
    Several researchers have dedicated themselves to the development of resistant  
varieties; however, issues of tolerance (the ability of a plant to compensate for dam- 
age) have received little attention. Resistance and tolerance are often regarded as  
antagonistic; however, it seems clear that tolerance traits are also governed by major  
genes and that breeding for tolerance is possible (Horgan and Crisol 2013). However,  
it has been difficult to define and screen for tolerance, and the effects of tolerance in  
the field are difficult to predict (Horgan  2012). For example, tolerance to disease  
may allow the buildup of disease-causing organisms including insect-vectored viral

12   Insect Herbivores of Rice                                                            293 

diseases. Similarly, tolerance to herbivores might cause larger and more widespread  
outbreaks in poorly managed production systems (Horgan 2012). 
   The benefit of tolerance for sustainable rice production systems (where natural  
enemies are promoted) is that it allows herbivore populations to attain relatively  
high numbers (compared to non-tolerant varieties) before they cause any economic  
damage to the crop. By maintaining densities of herbivores in rice fields, natural  
enemies can stabilize the herbivore populations. This suggests that highly tolerant  
hybrid rice varieties, although often reported as susceptible to herbivores, might be  
a good option for organic, pesticide-free, or other environmentally friendly produc- 
tion systems (Horgan and Crisol 2013; Horgan et al. 2016a). Tolerance is however  
also a feature of crop management. High fertilizer use in farmer’s fields results in  
faster growth rates and larger plants which often increases rice tolerance (Horgan  
and Crisol 2013; Horgan et al. 2016a). Therefore, the development of sustainable  
rice systems depends on a good knowledge of the rice variety and selection of the  
crop based on known resistance (including knowledge of resistance genes that are  
useful for the given region), plant-based tolerance, and proper nutrient management  
that avoids too high fertilizer levels for the yield potential of the variety. 

12.4.2       Creating a Healthy Rice Ecosystem 

12.4.2.1     Landscape Approaches to the Management of Herbivores 

Some herbivore management practices are effective at field scales. For example,  
farmers can opt to use resistant varieties, biological control agents, or pheromone  
traps in their fields to reduce herbivore damage (Lv et al.  2015). Changing farm  
management practices at landscape scales (because farmers widely adopt some new  
management practice) can profoundly affect herbivore population dynamics (Song  
et al.  1982; Kiritani  1988; Thies and Tscharntke  1999; Horgan and Crisol 2013;     
Srinivasan et al. 2016). Furthermore, the coordination of farmer activities can deter- 
mine the impact of landscape effects on herbivore populations, e.g., synchronized  
cropping has been implicated in reducing densities of stemborers and leafhoppers  
(Horgan and Crisol 2013), whereas it increases densities of planthoppers (Sawada  
et al.  1992; Wada and Nik Mohammad Noor  1992). Synchrony of cropping is an  
important criterion for reducing rice viruses that are vectored by insects (Chancellor  
et al.  1999). Landscape approaches to crop management are expected to contribute  
to  the  sustainability  of  production  landscapes  and  to  resilience  against  perturba- 
tions – including stabilizing the effects of poor management by one or other farmer  
at larger spatial and temporal scales. One landscape approach to pest management  
that is gaining increasing attention is ecological engineering. 

12.4.2.2     Agroecology and Ecological Engineering 

Ecological engineering is the deliberate manipulation of habitat for the benefit of  
society and the natural environment (Gurr 2009; Gurr et al. 2012). The method is  
strongly knowledge based and requires a thorough understanding of the potential

positive and negative effects of any interventions by the practitioner prior to imple- 
mentation. Ecological engineering for pest management mainly focuses on increas- 
ing the abundance, diversity, and function of natural enemies in agricultural habitats  
by providing refuges and alternate or supplementary food resources (Landis et al.  
2000; Lv et al. 2015). Research into ecological engineering in rice production sys- 
tems largely began in the early 2000s. Reports on the success of the method are now  
beginning to emerge from recent research conducted at landscape scales in Thailand,  
Vietnam, China, and the Philippines (Gurr et al. 2016; Horgan et al. 2016c). 
   During the 1990s, research from the Philippines, although not originally referred  
to  as  “ecological  engineering,”  examined  the  effects  of  weedy  bunds,  or  bunds  
planted with dry crops, on the mortality of rice herbivores at different distances  
from the bunds. These studies indicated that weeds and dry crops provide alternate  
hosts for some important natural enemies of planthoppers and stemborers; however,  
weedy  bunds  often  also  attracted  rice  herbivores  (Morrill  and  Almazan  1990;  
Marcos et al. 2001; Yu 2001; Way and Javier 2001). More recently, ecological engi- 
neering for rice pest management has focused on planting flower strips (with nectar  
producing ornamental flowers or flowering vegetable crops) along rice bunds. For  
example, several thousand hectares of rice have had flowers planted along bunds in  
South Vietnam following campaigns by local government (Westphal et al.  2015;  
Horgan et al. 2016c; Fig.  12.4). Flower strips are predicted to increase the habitat  
value of rice fields for the natural enemies of insect herbivores. Certain flowering  
plants have been shown to prolong the life or enhance reproduction of planthopper  
egg parasitoids and predatory mirid bugs in the laboratory (Zhu et al.  2013a, b).  
Furthermore, field studies have shown vegetable strips and vegetable plots to reduce  
planthopper populations in rice; however, the effects were not only due to natural  
enemies but also due to reduced “apparency” (the ability of the herbivore to find the  
crop) or to the vegetables acting as a physical barrier to herbivore dispersal (Lin  
et al. 2011; Yao et al. 2012). Planting strips of mung bean (Vigna radiata L. Wilzeck)  
on rice bunds in the Philippines has been shown to increase spider densities and the  
ratio of spiders to planthoppers in the rice (Horgan, unpublished data). 
   Apart from supporting populations of parasitoids and predatory arthropods, strips  
and plots of vegetables also provide habitat for insectivorous birds and  pollinators and  
will also produce fruits and vegetables as supplementary food for farm households  
(Horgan et al. 2017a, b; and  12.4). A multisite study conducted between 2009 and  
2012 in China, Thailand, and Vietnam found ecologically engineered rice landscapes  
to produce several economic and environmental benefits (Gurr et al. 2016). Data from  
across the sites indicated that flower strips on rice bunds could reduce planthopper  
populations, reduced insecticide applications by 70 %, increased rice grain yields by  
5 %, and delivered a 7.5 % economic advantage over conventional rice (Gurr et al.  
2016). It is clear from this study that the benefits of ecological engineering were due  
to the combined effects of flowering bunds creating a habitat for natural enemies  
together with a lower mortality of natural enemies (and possibly reduced potential for  
physiological resurgence of rice herbivores) because of reduced pesticide applica- 
tions (Gurr et al.  2016). In a related study, Lv et al. (2015) found lower herbivore  
damage, higher farm profits and benefits for the environment that included a higher  
abundance of frogs at an ecologically engineered site compared to conventionally

12   Insect Herbivores of Rice                                                                       295 

Fig. 12.4   High-diversity  
vegetation patches at a rice  
farm in Mindanao,  
Philippines. These patches  
were interspersed among  
the rice paddies and  
produced flowering fruits  
and vegetables including  
bitter gourd, mung bean,  
lady finger, and string  
beans. Natural enemies of  
key rice herbivores were  
attracted to the bitter gourd  
and mung bean flowers 

farmed sites (Fig.  12.5). These results point to ecological engineering as an exciting  
development for herbivore management in rice that promises to contribute to the sus- 
tainability and resilience of rice production systems as research continues. 

12.5       Concluding Remarks 

Rice  farmers,  agricultural  extension  officers,  and  researchers  will  need  to  reap- 
praise some common beliefs about yield losses to rice caused by insect herbivores  
and  about  the  effectiveness  of  insecticides  in  maintaining  or  increasing  grain  
yields. Three prominent beliefs are not substantiated by current scientific knowl- 
edge and should not be held as valid generalizations to guide management deci- 
sions. These are (1) that insects have generally negative effects on crop health, (2)  
that  herbivore  damage  translates  directly  to  yield  loss,  and  (3)  that  insecticides  
increase rice yields. Adherence to these unfounded beliefs will reduce the produc- 
tivity, profitability, and sustainability of rice production landscapes. Such negative  
consequences will be further enhanced in the face of global changes such as the  
phenomenal increases in modern industrial output (especially in China and India),  
in   mechanization,   in   communication   technologies   and   advertising,   and   in

Fig. 12.5   Indices of abundance of (a) predatory insects, (b) parasitoids, (c) damselflies, and (d)  
frogs (Rana limnocharis Gravenhorst) at an ecologically engineered site (grey points) and adjacent  
farmers’ fields (solid points) in China during 2010. The ecologically engineered site had vetiver  
grass (Vetiveria zizaniodes [L.]) and sesame (Sesamum indicum [L.]) planted on the rice bunds and  
reduced insecticide applications by 75 %. The farmers’ fields used insecticides only to control  
herbivores. Average rice yields at the sites were 10.0 t ha−1 at the ecologically engineered site and  
10.3 t ha−1 in the conventional farms. The engineered sites also gained US$ 120/ha from sesame  

production and saved US$ 150/ha on insecticides. To date, few field studies have assessed the  
potential of ecological engineering for pest management in rice (Redrawn from Lv et al. (2015)) 

transportation networks. A common understanding of the potential effects of cli- 
mate on herbivores is that it may affect species distributions and allow the expan- 
sion of pests and diseases to higher latitudes. However, concurrent changes in the  
distributions of natural enemies are expected to buffer against any negative impacts  
from expanding herbivore ranges (Kiritani  1999). It is therefore essential to pro- 
mote  a  holistic  approach  to  rice  production  that  emphasizes  “rice  ecosystem  
health.” This will be achieved by recognizing the deleterious effects of insecticides  
and  by  enhancing  the  overwhelming  benefits  of  natural  enemies  and  landscape  
diversity. Strategies, such as agroecology and ecological engineering that preserve  
food web complexity, ecosystem stability, and system resilience in rice landscapes,  
deserve further research attention and constitute an important avenue for attaining  
global food security.

13.1       Introduction 

Global  agriculture  has  undergone  a  significant  change  with  respect  to  input  use,  
 varietal  diversity  and  cropping  intensity  during  the  last  five  decades.  In  addition,  
 visible  changes  in  the  climatic  parameters  have  severely  affected  the  global  
 agriculture.  Globally  rice  is  the  principal  food  crop  especially  in  the  developing  
world. Achieving the increased production target for rice has become very  challenging  
due to unabated growth in global population and continuous loss of arable land to  
industrialization and human settlement. Scarcity of labour and water (particularly in  
the developing world with semi-mechanized farming) has become a barrier to higher  
rice production. Intensive rice cultivation accompanied by heavy use of fertilizers  
and pesticides is adopted in order to achieve high rice production. Non-judicious and  
over-exploitation of modern agricultural technologies has resulted in sickening of  
cultivable  lands,  contamination  of  groundwater  and  development  of  pesticide-  
resistant strains of pests and pathogens. Widespread cultivation of few high-yielding  
nitrogen-responsive varieties with narrow genetic base replacing the mosaic of local  
land races and traditional crop varieties has resulted in unabated spread and epidemic  
development of different plant diseases (Keneni et al. 2012). Mankind has seen many  
horrific instances of such epidemics of different plant diseases. The most dreaded

one was ‘The Great Irish Famine’ which occurred during 1845 due to widespread  
cultivation of genetically uniform clone of a single potato variety called ‘Lumper’  
coupled with favourable weather conditions (Zadoks and Schein 1979). Historically,  
rice crop has also suffered severe epidemics in the past. The ‘Great Bengal Famine’  
during 1942 where an estimated 2 million people died due to widespread occurrence  
of brown spot disease which devastated the rice crop in Eastern India (Strange and  
Scott 2005; Barnwal et al. 2013). Severe rice blast epidemics resulted in yield loss  
ranging from 10–50 % and caused a major food crisis in South Korea in the 1970s  
(Mew et al. 2004). Rice diseases have always affected the potential yields. Globally,  
yield losses in rice due to pests (diseases, animal pests and weeds) vary from 20 % to  
30 % of the attainable yields (Savary et al. 2012). 
   The use of disease-resistant cultivars and fungicide application play an important  
role  in  minimizing  the  yield  loss  caused  by  different  diseases.  Fungicide  use  in  
South Asia is highest in India and Vietnam where more than 75 % of the farmers  
apply fungicides (Heong and Escalada  1997) and is expected to increase further.  
Host resistance has played a major role in sustaining rice productivity, though major  
emphasis has been given mainly for the major diseases like bacterial blight (BB)  
and blast (Leung et al. 2003). Evenson (1998) predicted that modern high-yielding  
varieties (HYVs) with inbuilt resistance to rice diseases would contribute 7–10 %  
yield  gain  in  rice  production.  Several  resistant  rice  varieties  possessing  multiple  
bacterial blight resistance genes, released in different countries, viz. India, China,  
Indonesia and the Philippines, exhibited a yield advantage ranging from 11 to 31 %  
over  the  standard  popular  varieties  (Leung  et  al.  2004;  Sundaram  et  al.  2008;  
Gopalakrishnan et al. 2008). Several rice varieties are also being improved for blast  
resistance by pyramiding different blast resistance genes (Singh et al. 2011). Efforts  
are also being made to combine both blast and BB resistance in a single rice variety  
(Hari et al. 2013; Balachiranjeevi et al. 2015), and such varieties with inbuilt resis- 
tance to multiple biotic stresses are expected to further reduce the loss in rice yield  
due to biotic stresses. 
   Recently, the intensity and profile of rice diseases has been impacted by changes  
in several climatic parameters, especially temperature, relative humidity and rainfall  
pattern, changes in cropping pattern and intensity, increased use of inputs, changes  
in  varietal  composition  in  a  particular  region  and  widespread  cultivation  of  few  
selected high-yielding varieties (narrow genetic base). A number of research reports  
using  controlled  experiments  have  demonstrated  that  changes  in  environmental  
parameters can significantly affect the intensity of plant diseases. Kobayashi et al.  
(2006) demonstrated that a rise in CO  concentration increased leaf blast and sheath 2 
blight  development  indicating  that  potential  risks  of  rice  blast  and  sheath  blight  
would increase in rice grown under elevated CO . Temperature changes may also 2 
alter the level of host resistance. Webb et al. (2010) reported that though the effec- 
tiveness of most of bacterial blight resistance genes in rice reduces with increase in  
temperature,  BB  resistance  gene  Xa7  was  more  effective  at  higher  temperature  
(35:31 °C, day/night) than at lower temperature (29:21 °C, day/night) in restricting  
bacterial blight disease severity in rice and population of its pathogen, Xanthomonas  
oryzae pv. oryzae. An increase in total rainfall during the month of August resulted

in epidemic form of bacterial blight in Punjab, India (Sharma et al. 2007). Climate  
change would cause increased problem with insect-transmitted diseases, particu- 
larly in developing countries (Chauhan et al. 2014). 
    The changes in cultivation practices and climatic parameters have changed the  
rice disease scenario in different rice production systems globally, especially in Asia  
(Mew et al. 2004). Many diseases hitherto considered as minor have become very  
serious in many rice-growing areas. For example, false smut of rice, which was once  
considered as the sign of bumper harvest, has now become a serious problem in  
several countries (Ladhalakshmi et al.  2012b). The problems like neck blast and  
brown spot have become more widespread especially in Asia (Barnwal et al. 2013;  
Khan et al.  2014). Bakanae disease, which was considered a minor problem, has  
become  a  major  threat  to  rice  production  in  Northwestern  India  especially  on  
‘Basmati’ (scented) rice varieties. In the present chapter, discussion will be confined  
to major and emerging diseases of rice. 

13.2       Bacterial Diseases 

Many bacterial diseases are known to infect rice, viz. bacterial blight (Xanthomonas  
oryzae pv. oryzae), bacterial leaf streak (Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola), bacte- 
rial  panicle  blight  (Burkholderia  glumae),  bacterial  brown  stripe  (Acidovorax  
avenae  subsp.  avenae),  sheath  brown  rot  (Pseudomonas  fuscovaginae),  bacterial  
sheath  rot  (Pseudomonas  syringae  pv.  syringae)  and  bacterial  foot  rot  (Dickeya  
zeae, formerly Erwinia chrysanthemi). Out of these, bacterial blight and bacterial  
leaf streak being of economic importance are discussed. 

13.2.1       Bacterial Blight  

13.2.1.1      History and Geographical Distribution 

Bacterial blight (BB) of rice caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Ishiyama)  
Swings et al. (Xoo) is widely distributed throughout the globe (Fig.  13.1). The dis- 
ease  was  first  reported  from  Fukuoka  Prefecture,  Japan  in  1884.  However,  the  
causal bacterium was described in 1922. Subsequently, the disease was reported  
from East, South and Southeast Asian countries (Devadath  1992; Win et al. 2013)  
and Australia (Ou 1985). In Africa, the disease was first reported in West Africa by  
Buddenhagen et al. ( 1979) from Mali. Subsequently, it was reported from many  
other West African and some East African countries (Sere et al. 2013). The disease  
was  reported  from  most  of  the  rice-growing  areas  of  Caribbean  region,  namely,  
Mexico, Costa Rica, Honduras, Salvador and Panama and South America including  
Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador and Bolivia (Lozano  1977). From North America,  
Jones  et  al.  ( 1989)  reported  the  occurrence  of  BB  from  Texas  and  Louisiana.

However,  its  occurrence  has  not  yet  been  confirmed  from  Europe.  In  India,  the  
 disease was first reported from Maharashtra (Srinivasan et al.  1959), and with the  
widespread cultivation of semidwarf, high-yielding and nitrogen-responsive variet- 
ies like Taichung Native 1, it spread like wild fire in almost all the major  rice-growing  
regions. 

13.2.1.2      Economic Importance 

Though the disease is reported worldwide, it has economic importance mainly in  
Asia and in some parts of Western Africa (OEPP/EPPO  2007), especially in irri- 
gated and rain-fed lowland ecosystems. BB is essentially a monsoon season disease  
of high-yielding rice varieties grown under heavy nitrogen fertilization. BB epidem- 
ics in Northwestern India during 1979 and 1980 and in South India during 1998,  
2010 and 2013 (Laha et al. 2009; Yugander et al. 2014) are some of the examples of  
its destructive nature in the tropics. BB has become a major problem in several West  
African countries like Burkina Faso, Niger and Mali causing 50–90 % yield loss  
(Sere et al. 2005; Basso et al. 2011). Yield losses due to this disease ranging from 2  
to 74 % depending on varieties, season, weather conditions, stages of infection and  
nitrogen  application  have  been  reported  (Reddy  1989).  In  India,  inoculation  of  
pathogen 30 days after transplanting (DAT) resulted in a highest mean yield loss of  
30 %, which decreased significantly with delayed inoculation at 45 DAT and 75  
DAT. Among the varieties, the highest yield loss was recorded in Pusa Basmati-1  
(45 %) followed by Haryana Shankar Dhan-1 (31 %), while it was minimum in  
HKR  47,  i.e.  23  %  (Singh  et  al.  2013).  The  BB  disease  is  most  destructive  in

Southern China which is the major indica rice cultivation region. A major BB epi- 
demic was recorded in Changjiang River valley region during 1974–1975 (Qi 2009).  
The disease caused yield loss up to 50 % in the Philippines (Mew et al.  1993) and  
up to 26 % in Nepal (Adhikari and Mew 1991). There has been an alarming increase  
in BB incidence in Pakistan especially in ‘Kaller’ belt which is famous for rice cul- 
tivation (Khan et al. 2000; Akhtar et al. 2003). In Japan, 0.09–0.15 m ha rice crop  
was severely affected with BB with an annual loss of 0.022–0.11 m tons during  
1954. However, the disease incidence has markedly decreased after 1975. Though  
reported from few South and Central American countries, BB is not endemic in  
these regions (Corral et al. 2013). 

13.2.1.3     Symptoms 

BB is a typical vascular disease and has three distinct phases of symptoms. 

Leaf Blight Phase      It is the most common phase of this disease, in which water-  
soaked lesions appear on the tip of the leaves and increase longitudinally down- 
wards (Fig.  13.2b). Initially, the lesions are pale green in colour but later turn into  
yellow to straw coloured stripes with wavy margins. Lesions may start at one or  
both the edges of the leaves. Occasionally, the linear stripes may develop anywhere  
on the leaf lamina or along the midrib with or without marginal stripes. As the dis- 
ease advances, the lesion covers the entire leaf blade (Fig.  13.2d), turns white and  
later becomes greyish or blackish due to the growth of various saprophytic fungi. In  
humid  areas,  on  the  surface  of  the  young  lesions,  yellowish,  opaque  and  turbid  
drops of bacterial ooze may be observed during early morning (Fig.  13.2b), which  
dry up to form small, yellowish, spherical beads. 

Kresek or Wilt Phase      It is the most destructive phase of the disease in the tropics,  
which results from early systemic infection in the nursery or from seed infection.  
The leaves roll completely, droop and turn yellow or grey and ultimately the tillers  
wither away. In severe cases, the affected hills may be completely killed (Fig. 13.2c). 

Pale Yellow  Leaf  Phase      This  phase  of  the  disease  has  been  reported  from  the  
Philippines only. Some of the youngest leaves in a clump may become pale yellow  
or whitish. The diseased leaves later wither, turn yellowish brown and dry up. 

13.2.1.4     Pathogen 

Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Ishiyama) Swings et al. is a Gram-negative, non-  
spore- forming, rod-shaped, motile bacterium having a single polar flagellum. It pro- 
duces  a  characteristic  non-diffusible  yellow  pigment  called  xanthomonadin  (a  
brominated, aryl polyene pigment) and belongs to family Xanthomonadaceae, order  
Xanthomonadales, class Gammaproteobacteria and phylum Proteobacteria in the  
domain Bacteria (Fig.  13.2a).

13.2.1.5      Disease Cycle and Epidemiology 

Studies carried out under All India Coordinated Rice Improvement Project (AICRIP)  
and at International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), Manila, Philippines revealed  
that  although  a  high  percentage  of  seed  infection  can  be  observed  especially  in  
tropical regions, such seeds may not produce diseased plants (Laha et al. 2009). The  
ratoons and self-grown plants in lowlands constitute the primary source of inoculum  
in some parts of Asia. In double-cropped areas, infected straw and stubble, infected  
wild rice and living rice plants growing in ponds, ditches and irrigation channels  
during off season serve as a source of inoculum. Staggered sowing and transplant- 
ing result in overlapping of crops, and in such scenario the spread of the disease is  
very easy and fast. The pathogen surviving on some grasses like Leersia hexandra,  
Cyperus  rotundus  and  Panicum  repens  and  irrigation  water  contaminated  with

bacteria  flowing  through  the  fields  also  act  as  a  source  of  primary  inoculum.  
Combination of cloudy and rainy weather or drizzling condition, floods, cyclone or  
strong winds, excess and late top dressing of nitrogenous fertilizer and moderate  
temperature of 28–30 °C favour the rapid buildup of the BB disease (Ezuka and  
Kaku 2000). 

13.2.1.6     Disease Management 

As chemical control of the disease is not very successful especially in the tropics,  
host plant resistance is the best solution. Cultural practices, host nutrition and lim- 
ited chemical control measures help in reducing the initial inocula and secondary  
spread of the disease. 

Host Resistance     Breeding and deployment of high-yielding varieties (HYVs) car- 
rying major resistance genes (R genes) are the most effective approach for manag- 
ing the disease. Following the release of IR 20 and IR 22 as first BB-resistant HYVs  
from IRRI in 1969, a large number of BB-resistant varieties, mostly possessing BB  
resistance gene Xa4 , were released in different Asian countries during the 1970s and  
1980s  (Khush  et  al.  1989).  However,  these  varieties  have  become  susceptible  in  
many countries due to the appearance of new and more virulent forms of the patho- 
gen. Subsequently, plant breeders started incorporating other BB resistance genes  
like xa5 and Xa7 (Khush et al. 1989). Paradigm shift in BB resistance breeding took  
place with the discovery of a major dominant BB resistance gene, Xa21 , from wild  
rice Oryza longistaminata (Khush et al.  1990). 

   To date, more than 35 BB resistance genes have been identified from diverse  
sources (Sundaram et al. 2014; Kim et al. 2015). However, only a few genes, viz.  
Xa4 , xa5, Xa7 , xa13, Xa21 , Xa23 , Xa27 , Xa30(t)/Xa38 and Xa33 , are being used for  
marker-assisted selection (MAS) breeding. As the resistance conferred by single  
gene is often short lived, the best way to ensure the durability of resistance is to  
pyramid  multiple  resistance  genes  into  a  single  cultivar  using  MAS.  Using  this  
approach,  several  BB-resistant  varieties  have  been  released  by  introgressing  
 different BB resistance genes like Improved Samba Mahsuri (Xa21 , xa13 and xa5)  
and Improved Pusa Basmati-1 (Xa21 and xa13) in India (Laha et al. 2009; Singh  
et al. 2012a), Angke (Xa4 and xa5) and Konde (Xa4 and Xa7) in Indonesia, NSIC  
Rc142 (Tubigan 7) and NSIC Rc154 (Tubigan 11) having a combination of Xa4 and  
Xa21 in the Philippines and Zhonghui 8006 (Xa21), Zhonghui 218 (Xa21), Guodao  
1, Guodao 3, Guodao 6 and II You 8006 in China (Verdier et al. 2012; Rao et al.  
2014). Chen et al. (2000) improved BB resistance of Minghui 63, a restorer line  
widely used in China by introgressing Xa21 through MAS. Subsequently, Zhang  
et al. (2006) pyramided two BB resistance genes Xa7 and Xa21 in Minghui 63 for  
providing durable BB resistance. Studies on host plant resistance are not as exten- 
sive in Africa as in Asia. Banito et al. (2012) found NERICA 4, NERICA 8 and  
NERICA 14 as moderately resistant to BB, while Djedatin et al. (2011) found a few  
accessions of O. glaberrima as highly resistant to Xoo race A3 from Mali.

Chemical Control           Several chemicals, viz. Sankel, phenazine, cellomate, strepto- 
mycin,  chloramphenicol,  have  been  tested  and  used  for  the  control  of  bacterial  
blight  disease.  However,  none  of  these  chemicals  provided  satisfactory  control  
under  tropical  conditions  (Srivastava  1972).  Some  of  these  chemicals  may  offer  
partial control of the disease particularly when disease pressure is low. Two chemi- 
cals, ATDA  (2-amino-1,  3,  4-thiadiazole)  and  TF-130,  were  found  to  be  highly  
effective against the disease in Japan and other countries but were withdrawn on  
account of residues in seeds at non-permissible limits (Srivastava 1972). 

    Seed infection can be eradicated by soaking the seeds for 12 h in 0.025 % solution  
of Agrimycin 100 (an antibiotic containing 15 % streptomycin and 1.5 % terramycin)  
plus 0.05 % wettable Ceresan and then transferring the seed to hot water at 52–53 °C  
for  30  minutes.  Overnight  soaking  of  infected  seeds  in  100  ppm  Streptocycline  
(streptomycin  12  %  +  chlorotetracycline  hydrochloride  1.5  %)  solution  can  also  
effectively eradicate the seed infection. Two sprays of Agrimycin 100 (250 ppm) can  
effectively reduce the disease intensity and have been advocated for checking sec- 
ondary spread of the disease. Five sprays (at 12-day interval) of Agrimycin 100 and  
Fytolan (copper oxychloride) (50:500) or 665 ppm of Agrimycin 500 (streptomycin  
sulphate 1.75 % + terramycin 0.17 % + tribasic copper sulphate 42.4 %) can also  
satisfactorily reduce the disease (Singh et al. 1980). Application of ‘Klorocin’ (stable  
bleaching powder) at 12.5 kg/ha at nursery and 10 days after transplanting can reduce  
the disease (Laha et al. 2009). Singh et al. (2012b) recorded highest BB control in a  
treatment combination of single spray of 2,4-D ethyl ester (1.0 ml/l) with two sprays  
of Streptocycline (200 mg/l) + copper oxychloride (2.5 g/l). 

Cultural Control          The importance of cultural practices is being re-emphasized as  
an essential component in the integrated disease management practice. Practices  
like keeping the fields free of weeds like Cyperus spp. and Leersia spp.; removing  
infected  plant  debris,  self-grown  rice  plants  and  ratoons  and  infected  wild  rice;  
avoiding pruning of leaves either at the time of transplanting or later during the crop  
season;  avoiding  field  to  field  irrigation;  use  of  healthy  and  disease-free  seeds;  
 raising seedlings in raised seedbeds/upland nursery; and avoidance of inundation of  
nursery or main fields till maximum tillering stage can reduce the intensity of the  
disease. Judicious application of nitrogen in 3–4 splits without sacrificing yield with  
required level of potassium may be recommended during wet season (Ezuka and  
Kaku 2000; Laha et al. 2009). 

13.2.2        Bacterial Leaf Streak  

13.2.2.1       History, Distribution and Economic Importance 

Bacterial  leaf  streak  (BLS)  caused  by  Xanthomonas  oryzae  pv.  oryzicola  (Fang  
et al.) Swings et al. was first reported from the Philippines (Reinking  1918) as bac- 
terial leaf stripe. Since then, BLS has been reported from most of the countries in

tropical and subtropical Asia, Australia and several African countries like Burkina  
Faso, Burundi, Madagascar, Mali, Nigeria, Senegal and Uganda. The disease is cur- 
rently  widespread  and  of  economic  importance  in  tropical  Asian  countries  like  
India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Cambodia, Bangladesh and Thailand (Shekhawat and  
Rao 1972; Ou 1985; Nino-Liu et al. 2006; http://www.cabi.org/isc/datasheet/56977).  
The pathogen has been listed in the Agricultural Bioterrorism Protection Act of the  
United States as a potential bioterrorism agent, necessitating strict biosecurity and  
biosafety measures to avoid its release and spread in the environment (Nino-Liu  
et al.  2006). BLS is economically less important compared to bacterial blight of  
rice. Though extensive reports are not available, yield loss due to BLS may range  
from 1.5 to 17 % depending on the cultivars and climatic conditions (Opina and  
Exconde  1971). 

13.2.2.2      Symptoms 

Initial symptoms appear as fine, water-soaked to translucent interveinal streaks of  
various  lengths  anywhere  on  the  leaves  (Fig.  13.3).  The  lesions  enlarge,  turn  
yellowish- orange to brown (depending on cultivar) and eventually coalesce length- 
wise resulting in bigger streaks. With time, the leaves may be completely blighted.  
Numerous  tiny  yellow  beads  of  bacterial  exudate  are  commonly  found  on  the  
lesions. In many cases, concurrent occurrence of both BB and BLS in the same field  
or on the same leaf has also been noted. 

13.2.2.3      Pathogen 

The morphological characters and taxonomic position of Xanthomonas oryzae pv.  
oryzicola are similar to that of Xoo .

13.2.2.4     Disease Cycle and Epidemiology 

Infected seed is considered as the primary source of inoculum. The pathogen can  
survive from one season to another in infected seeds but not in the debris (Shekhawat  
and Srivastava  1972). In the double- and triple-cropped areas, the bacterium may  
survive on the living host itself. Infected wild rice can also be a source of inoculum.  
In addition, this bacterium may be able to survive in irrigation water. The bacte- 
rium penetrates the leaf mainly through stomata or wounds, multiplies in the sub-  
stomatal cavity and then colonizes the intercellular spaces of the parenchyma (Ou  
1985). In advanced stages, masses of bacteria ooze out through stomata and get  
deposited on the leaf surfaces which provide the inoculum for secondary spread by  
contact,  wind  and  rain.  Disease  development  is  favoured  by  drizzling,  stormy  
weather, high humidity, moderate temperature and excess application of nitroge- 
nous fertilizers. 

13.2.2.5     Disease Management 

Compared to BB, much less information is available on host plant resistance against  
this disease. Goto ( 1965) found that japonica cultivars are relatively more resistant  
compared to indica varieties. A number of varieties including Zenith, Tetep, H 4, S  
67, Co 4, BJ 1 and DZ 60 have been reported to be resistant to this disease (Ou  
1985). In contrast to BB, the genetic resistance to BLS in most of the germplasm is  
quantitative in nature (Tang et al. 2000). In India, varieties like IR 20, Jagannath and  
Krishna have shown good level of tolerance. In addition to Oryza gene pool, a non-  
host R gene, Rxo-1 from maize, when introduced in rice, conferred resistance to  
BLS (Zhao et al. 2005). Since the disease is known to be seed transmitted, the use  
of  disease-free  seeds  and  seed  treatment  by  soaking  the  seeds  in  0.025  %  
Streptocycline for 12 h or by hot water treatment at 50 °C for 30 minutes can prove  
effective against this disease. Spraying of Vitavax (0.15–0.3 %) has been found to  
be very effective against BLS (Shekhawat and Srivastava  1971). 

13.3      Fungal Diseases 

Of various fungal diseases attacking rice, leaf and panicle blast [Magnaporthe ory- 
zae  (anamorph:  Pyricularia  oryzae)],  sheath  blight  [Thanatephorus  cucumeris  
(anamorph:  Rhizoctonia  solani)],  brown  spot  [Cochliobolus  miyabeanus  (ana- 
morph: Helminthosporium oryzae)] and false smut [Villosiclava virens (anamorph:  
Ustilaginoidea virens)] are the most serious diseases. The emerging diseases like  
foot  rot  and  bakanae  [Gibberella  fujikuroi  (anamorph:  Fusarium  moniliforme)],  
sheath rot (Sarocladium oryzae) and stem rot [Magnaporthe salvinii (anamorph:  
Sclerotium oryzae)] are also causing significant yield losses in some rice-growing  
regions.

13.3.1       Rice Blast  

13.3.1.1       History and Geographic Distribution 

Rice  blast  caused  by  Pyricularia  oryzae  Cav.  [teleomorph:  Magnaporthe  oryzae  
(Hebert) Barr)] is the most severe and widely distributed disease of rice worldwide  
having significant economic importance (DRR  1975–2014; Ou  1985). This fungus  
has been ranked as at the top in the list of world’s top ten dangerous fungal pathogens  
of crops (Dean et al. 2012). Rice blast is one of the earliest known plant diseases and  
the record of its occurrence can be traced back to as early as the seventeenth century  
in China (Ou 1985). The disease has now been reported from >85 countries indicating  
presence of the disease practically in every place where rice is grown commercially  
(Fig.  13.4;  Ou  1985;  Kato  2001).  In  temperate  and  subtropical Asia,  it  is  highly  
destructive in lowland rice, while in tropical Asia, Latin America and Africa, it affects  
upland rice. In India, the disease gained importance when a severe epidemic occurred  
in Thanjavur (Tanjore) delta of South India in 1919. Presently in India, blast is espe- 
cially problematic in temperate areas, hilly tracts, tropical uplands and in delta regions. 

13.3.1.2       Economic Importance 

Blast is the principal biotic production constraint of rice. Several epidemics have  
been reported from different countries, and it has been estimated that the amount of  
rice that is lost annually due to blast can feed 60 million people (Zeigler et al. 1994).  
Average losses in the range of 10–30 % are typical although regional epidemics can  
be more devastating (Dean et al.  2012) resulting in grain yield loss up to 100 %

----------------------- Page 316-----------------------

314                                                                              G.S. Laha et al. 

under  favourable  conditions.  Different  estimates  of  yield  loss  ranging  from  5  to  
10 % in India, 8 % in Korea, 14 to 50 % in China, 60 % in Thailand and 50–85 % in  
the Philippines have been reported (Ou  1985; Wang et al. 2014). It is estimated that  
157 million tons of paddy was lost due to blast worldwide during 1975–1990 (Baker  
et al. 1997). Severe yield losses due to blast have been reported in different African  
countries ranging from 36 to 63 % in Burkina Faso, 35–50 % in Nigeria, 20–30 %  
in Benin, 64 % in Togo, up to 80 % in Sierra Leone and Cote d’Ivoire and up to  
100 % in Ghana and Gambia (Sere et al. 2013). Severe blast epidemics were reported  
on variety Newbonnet in Arkansas, USA (Lee  1994), and on a newly released vari- 
ety Colosso in Brazil (Prabhu et al. 2009) causing yield losses ranging from 25 to  
50 % and up to 100 %, respectively. 

13.3.1.3     Symptoms 

The fungus can infect leaves, nodes and various parts of the panicle. 

Leaf Blast     Greyish or bluish dots of 1–3 mm diameter appear on the leaf blades.  
On  susceptible  cultivars,  the  spots  enlarge  quickly  under  humid  conditions  and  
become elliptical or ‘eye shaped’ with grey or whitish centre and brown or dark  
brown margin (Fig.  13.5b, c). Fully developed spots on the susceptible cultivars  
may be 1–1.5 cm long and 0.3–0.5 cm broad. In severe infection, seedlings and  
plants in the nursery may be completely blasted or killed. On the resistant cultivars,  
minute brown specks of pinhead size may be observed. 

Node Blast     The pathogen also infects the nodes that turn black and get weakened  
due to tissue disintegration, resulting in breakage of stem at the nodal region fol- 
lowed by death of all the plant parts above the infected nodes (Fig.  13.5d). 

Neck and Panicle Blast         At the time of flowering, area near the panicle base is  
girdled by a greyish brown lesion, and the panicle falls over in the case of severe  
infection (Fig.  13.5e, f). The neck becomes shrivelled and covered with grey myce- 
lium. If neck infection occurs before the milk stage, the entire panicle may die pre- 
maturely,  leaving  it  white  and  completely  unfilled.  Later,  infections  may  cause  
incomplete grain filling and poor milling quality. The pathogen also causes brown  
lesions on panicle branches and on the spikelet pedicels, resulting in panicle blast.  
Infection of the neck, panicle branches and spikelet pedicels may occur together or  
may occur separately. 

13.3.1.4     Pathogen 

Rice  blast  pathogen,  Magnaporthe  oryzae  (previously  M.  grisea ;  anamorph:  
Pyricularia oryzae), is a filamentous ascomycetous fungus and is classified in the  
newly erected family Magnaporthaceae (Fig.  13.5a). M. oryzae is a heterothallic  
fungus and the population is composed of distinct mating types, viz. Mat 1-1 and

Mat 1-2 (Yoder et al. 1986). When the fertile isolates carrying opposite mating types  
are  paired  on  an  appropriate  medium,  they  will  form  sexual  fruiting  bodies,  i.e.  
perithecia within 21 days. However, isolates from rice are very rarely sexually fer- 
tile because most of the isolates belong to one mating type, i.e. female fertile except  
for a limited number of hermaphroditic strains (Notteghem and Silue  1992; Kumar  
et al.  1999; Kang et al. 2000). In contrast, isolates from other hosts like Eragrostis  
curvula, Eleusine indica or Eleusine coracana are usually hermaphrodite and capa- 
ble of mating and producing viable ascospores (Kang et al. 2000). The rice isolates  
can frequently undergo crosses with hermaphroditic strains from other grass hosts.  
However, progenies from such crosses are less aggressive on rice and backcrosses  
are  necessary  to  recover  full  pathogenic  potential  on  rice  (Notteghem  and  Silue  
1992; Priyadarisini et al.  1999). The sexual stage has not been observed in nature  
and the fungus mainly reproduces asexually through production of conidia. 

13.3.1.5      Disease Cycle and Epidemiology 

In temperate regions, mycelium and conidia on diseased straw and infected seeds  
are the principal sources of primary infection. The fungus can attack a number of  
cereal and grass hosts which could be important source of primary infection. In the  
tropical climate of South India, where several crops of rice are taken in a year, the  
pathogen maintains a continuous disease cycle on the rice crop itself. Under favour- 
able conditions, the conidia can produce symptoms within 4–5 days of infection.

316                                                                              G.S. Laha et al. 

Conidia are produced on the lesions 6–7 days after infection and disseminated by  
wind. A typical leaf blast lesion produces 2000–6000 conidia each day for about  
14 days. The rate of sporulation increases with increase in relative humidity, while  
release  and  flight  of  spores  increase  with  enhancement  in  dew  period  and  wind  
speed, respectively. The secondary cycles can be repeated many times during the  
growing season, with the potential for very high amount of disease within the crop.  
The disease intensity at the termination of vegetative growth phase influences the  
disease intensity during the reproductive phase. Spores produced near the end of the  
growing season may infect the collar of the flag leaf producing symptoms called  
‘collar rot’. They may also infect the neck when it emerges from the infected collar,  
causing ‘neck rot’ or ‘neck blast’ symptoms (Ou  1985). 
   Low  night  temperature  (below  24  °C)  alternating  with  a  day  temperature  of  
around 28–30 °C coupled with high relative humidity (more than 90 %) favours the  
disease development. Frequent rains, continuous spell of cloudy weather, dew, fog,  
high relative humidity and high nitrogen application favour rapid buildup of the  
disease. High incidence of blast in upland condition can be attributed to longer dew  
period, drought stress (which induces blast susceptibility) and low silica content  
(Sah and Bonman 2008; Dodan et al. 2007). 

13.3.1.6     Disease Management 

Though chemical control measures for managing the disease have been very suc- 
cessful, a major emphasis has been given to host plant resistance due to increased  
concern of ill effects of chemical pesticides. 

Host Plant Resistance        Development and use of rice varieties with effective and  
durable resistance to blast is the most promising choice for disease management.  
Systematic breeding for blast resistance in different countries like Japan, China, the  
Philippines,  India,  Korea, Thailand  and  other Asian  countries  and  in  the  United  
States led to the development and release of several blast-resistant varieties. Varieties  
like IR 64, Rasi and IR 36 expressed good level of blast resistance in India and  
elsewhere. A  blast-resistant  rice  variety  Katy  was  released  in  the  United  States  
(Moldenhauer et al. 1990). Several NERICA rice varieties like NERICA # 9, 12, 15,  
16 and 18 and other varieties like IRAT 13, ROK-16, LAC 23, Moroberekan and  
FARO 11 were found resistant to blast in several West African countries (Fomba and  
Taylor  1994). In India, rice genotypes HKR 04-487, HKR 05-436, HKR 05-476,  
Haryana Mahak 11, PAU 3237-1-B-B-19, PAU 3237-1-B-B-20 and PAU 3237-1-B-  
B-22 have been found resistant to both leaf blast and neck blast (Singh et al. 2010a).  
Breeding for resistance to blast has, however, often been frustrated by the rapid  
evolution of the pathogen to new and more virulent forms especially when the vari- 
etal resistance is based on single gene. 

    Gene pyramiding seems promising to provide broad spectrum and durable resis- 
tance. Since the identification of first blast resistance gene, Pia from japonica rice  
variety Aichi Asahi (Kiyosawa 1967), 100 blast resistance genes and 347 quantitative

trait loci (QTLs) have been identified from diverse germplasm (Koide et al.  2009;  
Sharma et al. 2012; Wang et al. 2014). Most of these genes have been identified from  
either japonica cultivars (45 %) or indica cultivars (51 %). Only four blast resistance  
genes have been identified from wild rice, viz. Pi9 from  O. minuta, Pi40 from  O.  
australiensis, Pi54rh from  O. rhizomatis and Pirf2-1(t) from O. rufipogon (Sharma  
et al. 2012; Wang et al. 2014). Wild rice still remains much untapped resource for  
blast resistance. Out of the 100 reported blast resistance genes, 22 Pi genes have been  
cloned and characterized (Sharma et al. 2012; Wang et al. 2014). Some of the blast  
resistance genes like Pi1, Pi2 (Piz5), Pi54, Pi40, Pi9, Pi5, Pita and Pizt have been  
found to confer high and broad level of resistance to blast pathogen in India and  
elsewhere (Prasad et al. 2010). Some of these genes have been used for gene pyra- 
miding for durable blast resistance. Hittalmani et al. (2000) pyramided three blast  
resistance genes Pi1, Piz5 and Pita into CO 39, a blast-susceptible cultivar, and the  
pyramided lines exhibited high level of blast resistance. Similarly, two blast resis- 
tance genes, viz. Pish and Pib, were pyramided in the genetic background of CO 39  
by Koide et al. (2010). Blast resistance genes Pi1, Pi2 and  Pi54 have been intro- 
gressed in two highly popular rice varieties BPT 5204 and Swarna (Prasad et al.  
2010). Singh et al. (2011) reported development of improved Pusa 6A, Pusa 6B and  
PRR 78, the parental genotypes of rice hybrid Pusa RH 10 by pyramiding two blast  
resistance genes, Pi54 and Piz5. Miah et al. (2013) advocated combination of major  
genes with QTLs (slow blasting components) for increased stability of blast resis- 
tance. Other strategies like use of cultivar mixtures, near isogenic multilines and use  
of  partial  resistance  (slow  blasting)  have  been  suggested  by  various  researchers  
(Kapoor 2010) to slow down the pathogen evolution. 

Cultural  Control      Cultural  practices  like  use  of  healthy  seeds  collected  from  
disease- free fields; destruction of weeds, collateral hosts and crop residues; raising  
seedlings in the water-covered seedbeds; balanced application of fertilizers; appli- 
cation of farm yard manure and rice husk ash; and wider spacing have been found  
to reduce the disease severity in the fields (Dodan et al. 2007). Adjustment of plant- 
ing time and continuous maintenance of standing water in the field have also been  
found to be helpful in minimizing the blast incidence (Singh et al.  1999). 

Biological Control      Reduction of blast disease severity under experimental condi- 
tion  by  application  of  different  biocontrol  agents  like  Pseudomonas  fluorescens,  
Bacillus   subtilis   and   B.   polymyxa   has   been   reported   by   several   workers  
(Gnanamanickam and Mew  1992; Chatterjee et al.  1996; Yoshihiriro et al. 2003;  
Kavitha et al. 2005). However, large-scale field evaluation is still required for com- 
mercial use of these organisms. 

Chemical Control      Chemical control has been practiced and found to be highly satis- 
factory at many places. Regular monitoring of the fields is an important aspect for  
successful management of the disease. For example, if leaf blast lesions are present  
during  the  booting  stage  and  if  environmental  conditions  are  favourable,  then  one  
application of a suitable fungicide is required to protect the panicles from neck blast

infection. In endemic areas, seed treatment with pyroquilon 50 WP at 1 g/kg or tricy- 
clazole 75 WP at 1 g/kg or carbendazim 50 WP at 2 g/kg has been found to protect the  
plants from seedling blast. When the leaf blast symptoms appear in fields, the options  
for chemical control include tricyclazole 75 WP at 0.6 g/l or iprobenphos 48 EC at 2 g/l  
or isoprothiolane 40 EC at 1.5 ml/l or kasugamycin 3 SL at 2.5 ml/l or carbendazim 50  
WP at 1 g/l or azoxystrobin at 1 ml/l or metominostrobin 20 SC at 2 ml/l. Many com- 
bination  products  like  tricyclazole  +  propiconazole,  tricyclazole  +  mancozeb,  tri- 
floxystrobin 25 % + tebuconazole 50 %, fenoxalin + isoprothiolane and epoxiconazole  
+  carbendazim  were  found  to  be  very  effective  against  blast  (DRR  1975–2014).  
However, the farmers are advised to strictly adhere to the use of recommended chemi- 
cals, their doses, formulation and time of application for better disease management  
and to overcome the problem of pesticide residues in rice grains and straw. 

13.3.2        Sheath Blight 

13.3.2.1      History and Geographical Distribution 

Sheath blight (Shbl), also known as ‘oriental sheath blight’ caused by Rhizoctonia  
solani Kuhn (AG 1 IA) [teleomorph: Thanatephorus cucumeris (Frank) Donk], is a  
potentially devastating fungal disease in all temperate and tropical rice production  
regions throughout the globe, particularly in irrigated rice production systems. The  
disease was first reported from Japan in 1910 by Miyake ( 1910) and subsequently  
from most of the East and Southeast Asian countries. Thereafter, the disease was  
reported from many African and North and South American countries (Fig.  13.6;  
Gangopadhyay  and  Chakrabarti  1982;  Dath  1990;  Dasgupta  1992;  Ou  1985;  

Fig. 13.6   Global distribution of sheath blight disease of rice

Sivalingam et al. 2006). In India, sheath blight was first reported from Gurdaspur  
(Punjab) by Paracer and Chahal (1963). 

13.3.2.2     Economic Importance 

It is a major production constraint in tropical Asia and in Southern United States.  
Yield losses ranging from 20 to 50 % have been reported depending on the intensity  
of infection and climatic conditions in different countries (Kozaka  1975; Lee and  
Rush  1983; Ou 1985; Rajan 1987; Kannaiyan and Prasad 1978a). However, under  
high disease severity, the yield loss may reach up to 70 % (Baby  1992). In earlier  
studies,  Hori  and Anraku  (1971)  reported  a  yield  loss  of  25  %  if  the  disease  is  
extended up to the flag leaves and in the range of 30–40 % in the case of severe  
infection of the sheath and leaf blades (Kozaka  1970). Studies carried out at IRRI,  
Philippines reported a 24 % yield loss in susceptible cultivars under highest level of  
disease intensity and nitrogen application (Anonymous 1976). In China alone, about  
15–20 million ha of rice area is affected by sheath blight, causing losses of 6 million  
tons of grains per year (Chen et al. 2014). Under conditions favourable for disease  
development, rice grain yield losses ranging from 4 to 50 % have been attributed to  
sheath blight in Southern United States (Marchetti 1983; Lee and Rush 1983; Groth  
and Bond 2007). In Arkansas, incidence of sheath blight was observed in 50–66 %  
of rice fields, causing 5–15 % yield losses in 2001 (Annou et al. 2005). 

13.3.2.3     Symptoms 

Typical  sheath  blight  symptoms  appear  as  greyish,  water-soaked  lesions  on  leaf  
sheaths  at  or  above  the  waterline. The  lesions  soon  enlarge,  with  irregular  dark  
brown margins, while the centre is bleached to greyish white. Appearance of many  
such lesions on the leaf sheath gives the look of snake skin (Fig. 13.7b). The infec- 
tion spreads rapidly to upper leaf sheaths and leaf blades of the same or adjacent  
tillers from the water level to flag leaf, ultimately causing death of whole leaf, tiller  
and the plant (Fig.  13.7c). Infected plants are usually found in a circular pattern,  
locally referred to as ‘bird’s nest’ bearing few grains only (Hollier et al. 2009; Fig.  
13.7e). Under moist conditions, brown silky mycelium and brown to dark brown  
sclerotia are found loosely attached on the lesions, which get easily dislodged from  
the plants at maturity (Ou 1985; Dath 1990). The pathogen can also cause infection  
in the nursery (Fig.  13.7d). The pathogen is also known to cause panicle infection  
resulting in production of unfilled, chalky and fissured kernels (Candole et al. 2000)  
and spotted/discoloured seed (Acharya et al. 2004). Seedlings raised from infected  
seeds bear brownish black to blackish discoloured lesions on coleoptile, first leaf,  
radicle, second leaf and sheath (Sivalingam et al. 2006). When the relative humidity  
is more than 90 % and temperature is in the range of 28–35 °C, infection spreads  
rapidly through runner hyphae to the upper plant parts and also to the neighbouring  
plants.

13.3.2.4      Pathogen 

The  teleomorph,  Thanatephorus  cucumeris,  belongs  to  class  Basidiomycetes.  In  
addition to its anamorph, R. solani (Fig.  13.7a), two other species of Rhizoctonia,  
viz.  R.  oryzae  causing  rice  sheath  spot  and  R.  oryzae-sativae  causing  aggregate  
sheath spot, have been found to be associated with this disease. All the three patho- 
gens may occur concurrently and sometimes referred to as rice sheath blight disease  
complex. 

13.3.2.5      Disease Cycle and Epidemiology 

Although  basidiospores  produced  by  T.  cucumeris  on  the  host  plant  can  initiate  
infection, it is generally considered unimportant in the epidemiology of rice sheath  
blight. Sclerotia produced by the fungus and to a lesser extent the fungal mycelium  
surviving in the plant debris serve as a major source of primary infection, particu- 
larly in humid tropics. Sclerotia can also survive for a long period in the temperate  
rice production areas. Different agricultural operations such as ploughing, levelling,  
transplanting and weeding help the surviving sclerotia to come up at the plant water  
surface  and  make  initial  contacts  with  the  host.  Rainwater  runoff  and  flood

13   Importance and Management of Rice Diseases                                            321 

irrigation permit good dispersal of floating sclerotia and consequently provide the  
primary  foci  of  infection  through  the  vast  stretches  of  rice  fields.  Several  weed  
plants, viz. Cynodon dactylon, Echinochloa crus-galli, E. colona, Euphorbia micro- 
phylla , Leptochloa chinensis, Dactyloctenium aegyptium, Dichanthium annulatum  
and Paspalum distichum, growing in and around paddy fields have been found to be  
naturally and artificially infected by the pathogen and can be an important source of  
primary infection (Singh et al. 2012c). In the tropics, infected straw piled up on the  
bunds, stubbles and infected weeds contribute significantly to the primary infection  
resulting in the appearance of the disease near the bund. The form attacking rice can  
also attack soybean causing aerial blight, and rice-soybean rotation has been attrib- 
uted to be one of the major factors for increased sheath blight intensity in Gulf Coast  
regions of the United States and parts of Brazil (Rodrigues et al. 2003; Groth and  
Bond 2007). In addition, the pathogen can also be seed-borne, and various workers  
have reported seed infection ranging from 10 to 39 % (Saksena and Chaubey  1972;  
Kannaiyan and Prasad 1978b; Dasgupta 1992). 
    Sheath blight is basically a disease of warm and humid area (28–30 °C tempera- 
ture and 96–97 % RH). Cultivation of high-yielding, semidwarf, nitrogen- responsive  
varieties with broad leaves and thick canopy, close planting and heavy application  
of nitrogenous fertilizers leading to increased plant-to-plant contact and increase in  
humidity in the microclimate during maximum tillering stage are known to further  
aggravate the disease. 

13.3.2.6     Disease Management 

In the absence of a desired level of resistance in commercially popular varieties to sheath  
blight, the disease management mainly relies on chemical control. Many good fungi- 
cides are available for the control of sheath blight. There is an increasing attempt to  
introduce integrated approach to manage this disease by combining the host plant resis- 
tance, cultural methods, biological methods and need-based application of chemicals. 

Host Plant Resistance       Presently none of the commercially popular varieties have  
desired level of resistance to sheath blight because of non-availability of high level  
of  resistance  in  O.  sativa  gene  pool.  However,  traditional  rice  cultivars  like  
Swarnadhan, Radha, Pankaj, Vikramarya, Tetep, Jasmine 85, Tequing, Bhasamanik,  
Lalsatkara and selected rice lines, viz. ARC 15762, ARC 18119, ARC 18275, ARC  
 18545, HKR 99-103, HKRH 1059 and IR 64683-87–2-2-3-3, have moderate level  
of resistance (Singh et al. 2010b; Srinivasachary et al. 2011). In China, Xie et al.  
(1992) reported good level of resistance in rice lines LSBR 5 and LSBR 33, while  
Zuo et al. (2009) reported high level of resistance in a novel rice line YSBR 1, devel- 
oped  from  a  cross  between  japonica  and  indica  rice.  Moderate  to  good  level  of  
resistance has been reported from different wild rice accessions like  O. nivara, O.  
rufipogon, O. meridionalis, O. barthii and O. latifolia (Ram et al. 2008; Prasad and  
Eizenga 2008). The resistance to sheath blight is a complex and quantitative charac- 
ter governed by polygenes, though some reports suggest that sheath blight resis- 
tance in some rice cultivars is controlled by few major genes (Pan et al.  1999). 

----------------------- Page 324-----------------------

322                                                                             G.S. Laha et al. 

    Over the past two decades, several sheath blight resistance quantitative trait  
loci (QTLs) have been mapped in different rice cultivars like Tetep, Tequing and  
Jasmine 85 (Srinivasachary et al. 2011). However, many of them are reported to  
be associated with plant morphological traits and heading dates. Some of these  
QTLs, confirmed to be associated with sheath blight resistance, could be used for  
pyramiding into popular rice varieties. Singh et al. (2012a) developed improved  
Basmati rice lines by combining xa13 , Xa21 , Pi54 and a major QTL qSBR 11-1  
for  bacterial  blight,  blast  and  sheath  blight  resistance  through  marker-assisted  
backcross  breeding.  Subsequently,  Zuo  et  al.  (2014)  reported  that  pyramiding  
sheath blight resistance QTL qSB-9TQ and morphological trait QTL TAC 1TQ is a  

potential approach in improving sheath blight resistance as these QTLs exhibited  
more resistance than the near isogenic lines (NILs) containing only one of them. 
    Introduction of different chitinase genes (Chi11 and RC7 from rice), McCHIT (a  
class I chitinase gene of bitter melon),  Cht42 (a chitinase gene from  Trichoderma  
spp.), thaumatin-like protein (tlp) gene, a member of the PR-5 group of PR protein  
genes, pinA and pinB (structural protein from Triticum aestivum), Ace-AMP1 (non-  
lipid transfer protein from Allium cepa), β-1,3-glucanase (tobacco β-1,3-glucanase),  
Rs-AFP2 (defensin gene from Raphanus sativus), Dm-AMP1 (defence gene from  
Dahlia merckii), npr1 (non-expressor of PR-1) and rice oxalate oxidase 4 (Osoxo4)  
in different rice cultivars resulted in increased tolerance to rice sheath blight dis- 
ease. Simultaneous co-expression of some transgenes like rice chitinase (chi11) and  
β-1,3-glucanase,  chi11 and tlp, maize ribosome inactivating protein gene  MOD1  
and a rice basic chitinase gene RCH10 showed enhanced resistance against sheath  
blight  infection  (Datta  and  Datta  2009;  Srinivasachary  et  al.  2011;  Molla  et  al.  
2013). 

Induced  Resistance  and  Biological  Control            Few  reports  suggest  that  resis- 
tance can be induced in rice plants against sheath blight pathogen either by cer- 
tain chemicals or by plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (Manibhushan Rao  
et  al.  1990). Application  of  certain  tolerance-inducing  chemicals  such  as  sali- 
cylic acid, gamma- aminobutyric acid and chitosan through seed treatment and/or  
foliar application was found to reduce sheath blight disease significantly (Laha  
et al.  1997; Dantre and Rathi 2007; Liu et al. 2012). Nandakumar et al. (2001)  
reported induced systemic resistance against sheath blight of rice by strains of  
Pseudomonas fluorescens . Several reports have indicated that application of dif- 
ferent antagonistic bacteria like P. fluorescens, P. putida and Bacillus subtilis can  
substantially  reduce  sheath  blight  disease  severity  (Mew  and  Rosales  1992;  
Krishnamurthy  and  Gnanamanickam  1997;  Laha  and Venkataraman  2001).  In  
China, a microbial pesticide ‘Wenquning’ (based on Bacillus subtilis) has also  
been found to be effective against sheath blight (Ren 2007). Several commercial  
botanical  pesticides  like  TriCure  and  Achook  (both  containing  azadirachtin),  
Biotos  (a  product  from  Gaultheria)  and  Spictaf  were  found  to  reduce  sheath  
blight  disease  severity  (Muralidharan  et  al.  2003a;  Biswas  and  Roychoudhury  
2003; Kandhari 2007).

13   Importance and Management of Rice Diseases                                                    323 

Cultural Control         Cultural practices like wider spacing (to reduce high humidity  
in the plant ecosystem and to reduce plant-to-plant contact), destruction of stubbles  
and weeds in and around rice fields, adoption of green manuring, avoidance of field  
to field irrigation, planting of rice seedlings a little distance away from the bunds  
and keeping the bunds and field free from alternate and collateral weed hosts can  
significantly reduce sheath blight disease severity. Several studies have indicated  
that  soil  amendments  with  different  organic  manures  like  Sesbania  aculeata,  
Crotalaria juncea,  Gliricidia leaves and neem cake can drastically reduce sheath  
blight  disease  intensity. Application  of  silica  has  also  been  shown  to  reduce  the  
intensity of sheath blight (Rodrigues et al. 2003). 

Chemical  Control         The  disease  can  be  effectively  managed  by  applying  various  
chemicals like validamycin 3 L at 2.5 ml/l or propiconazole 25 EC at 1 ml/l or hexa- 
conazole 5 EC at 2 ml/l or carbendazim 50 WP at1 g/l or thifluzamide 24 SC at 30 g  
a.i./ha. Several researchers have recorded excellent control of sheath blight with foliar  
application of strobilurins, especially azoxystrobin. Many a times, the disease appears  
in patches near the bunds and progresses inside the main fields. In such cases, spray- 
ing can be restricted to those patches to reduce the amount of fungicide application  
and to check further spread of the disease inside the field. Singh et al. (2010c) reported  
that hexaconazole and diniconazole reduced the disease severity by 72 and 69 %,  
respectively, along with an enhanced grain yield. Many combination products like  
Filia 52.5 SE (tricyclazole and propiconazole combination), Nativo 75 WG (trifloxys- 
trobin and tebuconazole combination) and Lusture 37.5 SE (flusilazole and carben- 
dazim combination) have also been found very effective against this disease. 

13.3.3       False Smut  

13.3.3.1      History and Distribution 

False  smut  caused  by   Ustilaginoidea  virens  (Cooke)  Takahashi  [teleomorph:  
Villosiclava  virens  (Nakata)  Tanaka  and  Tanaka]  was  first  reported  in  India  by  
Cooke in 1878, and subsequently, the disease was reported from more than 60 coun- 
tries including China, the Philippines, Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand, Bangladesh,  
Burma, Brazil, Fiji, Japan, Pakistan, Egypt, Nepal, Nigeria, the United States and  
France  (Biswas  2001; Ahonsi  and Adeoti  2002; Atia  2004;  Brooks  et  al.  2010;  
www.plantwise.org/KnowledgeBank). 

13.3.3.2      Economic Importance 

False smut disease had been recognized as a symbol of bumper harvest and in  
some  parts  of  Southern  India  it  is  popularly  known  as  “Laxmi”  (goddess  of  
wealth  and  prosperity)  disease.  However,  with  changed  cultivation  practices

involving widespread use of high-yielding varieties, hybrids and heavy use of  
chemical fertilizers coupled with changes in the climatic parameters, the  disease  
has become a serious problem in different rice ecosystems (Ladhalakshmi et al.  
2012a). The yield losses in different states of India have been estimated to vary  
between 0.2–49 % depending on disease severity and rice varieties (Dodan and  
Singh 1996). In China, 50–60 % of disease infection with the yield reduction of  
5–30 % was reported (Sanghera et al. 2012). Over 25 % yield reduction due to  
false smut was reported from Tumbes Valley in Peru (Atia 2004). In hybrid rice  
cultivation, incidence of false smut during the rainy season reduced the yield to  
3 t/ha as against 6 t/ha (Elazegui et al. 2009). In Egypt, yield losses ranged from  
1 to 11 % (Atia 2004). Globally, yield loss due to false smut has been reported  
to range between 3 and 81 % depending on the rice variety and disease intensity  
(Haiyong  et  al.  2015).  In  addition  to  direct  loss  to  the  crop,  the  fungus  also  
produces  a  toxin  known  as  ‘Ustiloxin’  (Koiso  et  al.  1994)  which  can  inhibit  
seed germination and is also poisonous to domestic animals and humans (Koiso  
et al.  1998). 

13.3.3.3      Symptoms 

Pathogen affects young ovary of individual spikelets and transforms them into yellow,  
olive green to blackish spore balls (smut balls) known as pseudomorph (Fig. 13.8a, e).  
Initially,  the  fungal  growth  is  confined  between  glumes  which  later  get  enlarged  
enclosing the floral parts. Young smut balls are white in colour enclosed in a whitish

smut ball covered with whitish membrane; (c) sclerotia of  U. virens; (d) ovoid minute conidia of  
U. virens; (e) severe false smut infection under field condition

membrane (Fig.  13.8b). Subsequently, the membrane bursts, releasing orange spore  
masses which later turn into olive green to black. 

13.3.3.4     Pathogen 

U. virens produces both sexual (ascospores on sclerotia) and asexual (chlamydo- 
spores  and  conidia)  stages  in  its  life  cycle  (Biswas  2001).  Sclerotia  are  found  
embedded inside or loosely attached to the pseudomorph or sometimes cover the  
pseudomorph (Fig.  13.8c). Sclerotia are clavate, reniform, horseshoe shaped to  
indefinite in shape, concave on the inner side, convex on the outer side and hard  
in nature. Overwintered sclerotia on germination produce stalked stromata which  
contain  perithecia,  and  each  flask-shaped  perithecium  contains  cylindrical  asci  
with  a  hemispherical  apical  appendage.  Each  ascus  contains  eight  ascospores  
which  are  hyaline,  one  celled  and  filiform  (Tanaka  et  al.  2008).  The  yellow- 
coloured chlamydospores on germination bear hyaline, ovoid and minute conidia  
(Fig. 13.8d). 

13.3.3.5     Disease Cycle and Epidemiology 

Sclerotia act as a major source of primary inoculum and chlamydospores play an  
important  role  in  the  secondary  infection.  Release  of  ascospores  from  sclerotia  
coincides with the anthesis of rice crop and initiates infection on the floral parts  
producing chlamydospores. These airborne chlamydospores may cause infection  
again. In addition, hibernated chlamydospores from the soil can also infect the rice  
panicles. In the hilly areas, the presence of sclerotia can serve as primary inocu- 
lum, whereas in the plain region, chlamydospores act as primary inoculum. Other  
than rice crop, the pathogen also infects maize (Abbas et al.  2002; Gohel et al.  
2014) and different weed species, viz. Echinochloa crus-galli, Digitaria margin- 
ata, Panicum trypheron and  Imperata cylindrica. Prevalence of conducive envi- 
ronmental  conditions  like  low  temperature  (especially  low  night  temperature),  
high  humidity  (>90  %)  and  drizzling  conditions  during  flowering  time  favours  
disease development. 

13.3.3.6     Disease Management 

Use of resistant or tolerant varieties, chemical and cultural practices is important for  
management of the disease. 

Host Plant Resistance      In India, several rice cultivars were reported to be resistant or  
tolerant to false smut under natural conditions, viz. Anupama, Cauvery, China 988,  
Govind, HKRH 21, MTU 1067, Sakha 102, VL 501, HKR 47, HKR 127, Jhelum and  
Shalimar Rice-1, HKR 95-222, HKR 98-418, HKR 08-12, HKR 08-17, HKR 08-71,

HKR 08-110, IR 50, Paicos-1, PR 113 and PR 114 (Singh et al. 2010b; Sanghera et al.  
2012, Dodan et al. 2013; Lore et al. 2013; Singh and Sunder 2015). In China, quantita- 
tive resistance was reported against false smut disease by Zhou et al. (2013). 

Cultural Methods          Several cultural practices like use of sclerotia free seeds, clean- 
ing of bunds, adjustment of sowing dates to avoid coincidence of booting stage with  
rainy period and application of balanced fertilizer can substantially reduce disease  
incidence in the fields. Furrow-irrigated rice cultivation system has been reported to  
have less disease severity compared to flooded fields (Dodan and Singh 1995, 1996;  
Ladhalakshmi et al. 2012b). 

Chemical Control          Several fungicides have been found to be effective in reducing  
false smut disease severity. In India, spraying fields during flowering with chloro- 
thalonil 75 WP at 2 ml/l or copper oxychloride 50 WP at 4 g/l or epoxiconazole 12.5  
EC at 2 ml/l or propiconazole 25 EC at 1 ml/l have been found to be effective (Singh  
et al.  2002a). Foliar spraying of a combination fungicide, trifloxystrobin 25 % +  
tebuconazole 50 % (Nativo 75WG) at booting or 50 % panicle emergence stage and  
application of simeconazole at submerged condition 3 weeks before heading have  
also been found to be highly effective against false smut (Tsuda et al. 2006; Singh  
and Sunder 2015). 

13.3.4       Foot Rot and Bakanae  

13.3.4.1      History and Geographical Distribution 

The disease was known in Japan since 1828. It has also been called as Fusarium  
blight, elongation disease, fusariosis and white stalk in China; palay lalake or man  
rice  in  British  Guiana;  foot  rot  in  the  Philippines;  otoke  nae  (male  seedling)  in  
Japan; bakanae in the United States, Africa and Australia; foot rot and bakanae in  
French Equatorial, Africa and Ceylon; and foolish plant or foot rot in India. The  
disease is widely distributed in almost all rice-growing areas of the world including  
Africa (Ivory Coast, Kenya, Nigeria, Tanzania, Uganda and Cameroon), Asia (India,  
Japan, Thailand, Vietnam, Ceylon, Indonesia, Malaysia, Taiwan, Pakistan, Iran, the  
Philippines, Bangladesh, China and Nepal), some North and South American coun- 
tries  (Suriname,  British  Guiana,  Trinidad,  the  United  States,  Venezuela,  Brazil,  
Mexico),  Australia   and   some   European   countries   (Italy,   Spain   and  Turkey)  
(Gangopadhyay 1983; Ou 1985; Khokhar 1990; Singh and Sunder 2012). 

13.3.4.2      Economic Importance 

The disease is commonly seen in many parts of Southeast Asia, but percentage of  
infection  is  usually  small.  However,  under  favourable  conditions,  it  has  been  
reported to cause 20–50 % yield loss in Japan, 70 % to almost complete loss in

Fig. 13.9  Symptoms of foot rot and bakanae disease of rice: (a) elongated seedlings in seedbed;  
(b)  field  view  of  bakanae  in  planted  crop;  (c)  wilting  or  dying  of  plants;  (d)  mycelium  and

heads 

Australia, 4–15 % in Thailand, 5–23 % in Spain, 3–95 % in India, 40 % in Nepal  
and 7–58 % in Pakistan (Singh and Sunder 1997; Yasin et al. 2003). 

13.3.4.3      Symptoms 

Gibberella fujikuroi causes elongated, slender, pale seedlings that are conspicuous  
and found to be scattered in the field. Infected seedlings may also be stunted and  
chlorotic, showing crown or foot rot symptoms. The disease occurs both in main and  
ratoon crops, in seedbeds as well as in the field (Fig. 13.9a, b).The infected seedlings  
usually die either before or after transplanting. Often diseased plants have fewer til- 
lers, and their leaves dry one after the other, wilt and die within a few weeks (Fig.  
13.9c). The presence of white or pink mycelial growth (Fig.  13.9d), adventitious  
roots from the lower nodes (Fig. 13.9e) and wider leaf angles with stem are the other  
diagnostic  features  of  the  disease.  Plants  surviving  till  maturity  bear  only  empty  
panicles (Fig.  13.9f). In Japan, infected panicles are often termed as pink panicles. 
    The fungus is also known to cause grain infection at maturity and pre-emergence  
seedling death. The type of symptoms produced is mainly determined by the rela- 
tive amount of growth hormones (gibberellic acid and fusaric acid) produced by the  
fungus, which are dependent on fungus strain, inoculum level and nutritional condi- 
tions of the soil (Webster and Gunnell  1992; Singh and Sunder 2012). At the end of  
season, lower sheaths become blue and turn into black colour having small scattered  
pycnidia. Perithecia are also produced on the diseased plants under favourable con- 
ditions (Sun and Snyder  1978).

 13.3.4.4     Pathogen 

Perithecia  of  G.  fujikuroi  (Sawada)  Wollenweber  (anamorph:  Fusarium  monili- 
forme  Sheldon) are dark blue and globose to conical, 200–400 × 150–400  μm in  
dimension. Asci are ellipsoid to clavate and contain 4–8 hyaline, elliptical, 1–3 sep- 
tate ascospores measuring 15–18 × 6.7  μm. Microconidia are hyaline, oval to cla- 
vate,  single  celled,  5–12  ×  3–3.5  μm  and  formed  in  chains  or  false  heads  from  
monophialides. Macroconidia are somewhat sickle shaped to almost straight, with a  
foot-shaped basal cell, usually 3–5 septate, and measure 8.4–66 × 2.4–3.5 μm. The  
fungus does not produce chlamydospores. Dark blue sclerotia are sometimes pres- 
ent (Hashioka  1971; Ou 1985). 

 13.3.4.5     Disease Cycle and Epidemiology 

The disease is seed-borne and is primarily seed transmitted. The seed infection is  
caused  by  secondary  airborne  conidia  and  ascospores,  discharged  from  diseased  
plants from heading to harvest. The fungus is both internally and externally seed-  
borne,  and  its  recovery  was  higher  from  lemma  and  palea  than  endosperm  and  
embryo (Manandhar 1999). The pathogen can survive in endosperm and embryo to  
the extent of 15 % and 6 %, respectively, till commencement of next crop season  
 (Kumar and Sunder 2015). Raza et al. (1993) reported a maximum of 22 % seed  
infection from naturally infested samples from Pakistan. The fungus grows inter- 
cellularly in stigma and anthers within 48 h and finally reaches and covers the ovary.  
 Sowing of 100 % infected seeds produced 30–68 % diseased seedlings. The fungus  
 also survives in soil in infected crop residues as thick-walled hyphae or macroco- 
nidia, but it is of less significance (Singh and Sunder 2012). 
    The fungus infects rice seedlings through roots or crowns and grows systemi- 
cally in the plants, where it produces growth hormones gibberellins and fusaric acid.  
The mycelium and microconidia of the pathogen concentrate in the vascular bun- 
dles, especially in the large pitted vessels and lacunae of the xylem vessels of stem,  
leaf blades, sheaths and adventitious roots (Singh and Sunder  1997). The disease is  
favoured by high temperature (30–35 °C), injury to the roots of seedlings during  
uprooting and application of high dose of nitrogenous fertilizers. Chan et al. (2004)  
observed that sprouting period was the most sensitive for infection. 

 13.3.4.6     Disease Management 

Host Plant Resistance        Cultivation of resistant varieties is the most effective, safe  
 and practical mean of avoiding loss in crop yield. Several genotypes, viz. Co 18, Co  
 22, ADT 8, PTB 7, GEB 24, GSL-66, GSL-67, GSL-68, IR 20, IR 26, IR 32, IR 38,  
IR 44, IR 45, KS 133 and Punjab Mahak, have been found to possess tolerance/ 
resistance to bakanae (Ghazanfar et al. 2013; Kumar et al. 2014), and some of these  

----------------------- Page 331-----------------------

13   Importance and Management of Rice Diseases                                         329 

lines can be used as donor in breeding programme. Reaction of rice genotypes to  
bakanae has been reported to be crop growth stage dependent. In China, Lu ( 1994)  
observed that rice genotype Longjiao 86074-6 was resistant at the seedling stage but  
moderately susceptible at the adult stage; Qingxi 96 was moderately resistant at the  
seedling stage but resistant at the adult stage, while cultivars Zupei 7, Dongrong  
84-21, G-6 and Sui 89-17 were moderately resistant at both stages. Resistance in  
rice against bakanae is monogenic, recessive in IR 6 and dominant in KS 282. Two  
quantitative trait loci (QTLs), namely, QB 1 and QB 10 on chromosomes 1 and 10,  
have been identified for bakanae resistance, which exhibited additive effect (Kumar  
et al.  2014). Coarse varieties were more tolerant to bakanae disease than the fine  
ones (Ghazanfar et al. 2013). All dwarf and semidwarf genotypes carrying genes d  
29, Sd 6 or Sdq (t) showed resistance and may be used as donors for improvement  
of bakanae resistance in rice breeding programme (Ma et al. 2008). 

Cultural Management         Uprooting rice nursery in standing water, late planting and  
rotating  rice  with  pasture  crops  proved  effective  in  avoiding  bakanae  infection.  
Removal and destruction of infected plants from the field can help in minimizing  
the inoculum and reducing seed-borne infection. Applications of potassium and soil  
amendment with neem cake, groundnut cake (Kumar et al.  2014) and sugarcane  
press mud (authors’ observation) have also been found to suppress the pathogen.  
The disease incidence was significantly lower when nursery was raised by sowing  
seeds under dry conditions compared to sowing of sprouted seeds in puddled beds  
(Sunder et al. 2014b). 

Biological Control and Use of Botanicals           Several fungal and bacterial antago- 
nists and botanical extracts are known to suppress mycelial growth, conidia produc- 
tion and germination of F. moniliforme and to reduce disease incidence significantly.  
Kumar et al. (2014) reported effectiveness of several strains of Pseudomonas fluo- 
rescens,  Bacillus  subtilis,  B.  megaterium,  Trichoderma  harzianum,  T.  virens,  T.  
asperellum and  Talaromyces spp. in suppressing bakanae disease. Treating seeds  
with antagonists such as B. subtilis, T. harzianum and T. virens reduced the disease  
severity (Dehkaei et al. 2004). Combining the biocontrol agents as seed treatment  
was more effective than spraying antagonists. Seed treatment with metabolites pro- 
duced by different soilborne bacteria also efficiently inhibited bakanae development  
(Motomura et al. 1997). In China, high efficacy of two antagonistic bacterial strains,  
viz. B-916 and P-91, has been reported against bakanae (Chen et al.  1998). Kumar  
et al. (2014) reported that extracts of Azadirachta indica and Decalepis hamiltonii  
and oil of Hedychium spicatum and Acorus calamus were highly anatagonistic to  
pathogen growth. Aerated vermicompost tea was found highly effective in field tri- 
als (Kumar et al. 2014). 

Chemical Control       Salt water can be used to separate lightweight, infected seeds  
from seed lots, thereby reducing the seed-borne inoculum. Seed soaking in 0.1 %  
solution of organomercury compounds (acetate and chloride groups) for 16–24 h or  
in 0.25 % solution for 2 h was recommended in Japan (Ou  1985). Effective disease

control has also been reported by seed dressing or slurry treatment with different  
fungicides and their combinations like benomyl, benomyl + thiram, mancozeb +  
benomyl,  carbendazim,  carbendazim  +  mancozeb,  propiconazole,  thiophanate-  
methyl, thiophanate-methyl + thiram, prochloraz, prochloraz + carbendazim, kasu- 
gamycin, triforine, carboxin + thiram, iprodione and ferimzone in different parts of  
the world. Seed treatment with carbendazim (0.5 g/l) + Streptocycline (0.01 g/l) for  
12 h and smearing of the seeds with talc formulation of T. harzianum at 15 g/kg of  
seed immediately before sowing and seedling root dip with T. harzianum at 15 g/l  
water proved most effective against bakanae (Kumar et al. 2014). 

    Beside seed treatment, seedling dip in 0.1 % carbendazim or benomyl for 6–8 h  
(Bagga and Sharma 2006) and soil drenching with carbendazim and difenoconazole  
proved highly effective in curtailing the disease. Foliar application of benzimidazoles  
(benomyl and carbendazim) at 0.1 % significantly reduced grain infection by the patho- 
                                                                                             2 
gen. In addition, sand mix application of carbendazim in nursery beds at 1 g/m , 7 days  
before uprooting of seedlings, also helps in reducing bakanae incidence in the main field  
(Kumar et al. 2014; Sunder et al. 2014b). Suzuki et al. (1994) reported the effectiveness  
of EC formulation of triflumizole (Trifmine) in reducing the bakanae disease. 

13.3.5       Brown Spot  

13.3.5.1      History and Geographical Distribution 

Brown spot of rice is known to occur in Japan since 1900. It has been reported from  
almost all the countries of Asia, Africa, South and North America including the  
Caribbean  region,  Australia  and  several  European  countries  like  France,  Spain,  
Portugal, Switzerland, Serbia, Greece and Turkey (Ou  1985; Khalili et al. 2012;  
www.plantwise.org). 

13.3.5.2      Economic Importance 

Brown spot disease appears to be more on rain-fed rice where rice is grown in poor  
soils coupled with erratic rainfall or water supply and nutritional imbalances, espe- 
cially nitrogen and available potassium. There are indications of increased occur- 
rence of brown spot in recent years (Savary et al. 2005), perhaps due to changes in  
climatic conditions especially rainfall pattern. Average grain yield loss ranging from  
4 to 52 % has been reported from different countries (Sunder et al. 2014a). However,  
losses up to 90 % have been observed under certain conditions especially in the  
rain-fed ecosystem, where water supply is scarce, combined with nutritional imbal- 
ance, particularly lack of nitrogen (Sunder et al. 2014a). This disease has historic  
importance as it caused heavy yield losses in Eastern India which is considered to  
be a major factor for the ‘Bengal Famine’ during 1942. Beside quantitative losses,  
it is also known to reduce the quality and germinability of the seed.

13.3.5.3      Symptoms 

The disease appears on coleoptiles, leaf sheath and leaf blade as brown spots with  
grey or whitish centre, cylindrical or oval in shape resembling sesame seeds usually  
with yellow halo on leaves (Fig.  13.10a, c). On glumes, black or dark brown spots  
are produced resulting in discoloured and shrivelled grains. Under favourable con- 
ditions, dark brown conidiophores and conidia develop on the spots giving a velvety  
appearance. Young roots may also show blackish lesions (Ou  1985). The pathogen  
has also been reported to cause brown to dark brown lesions on panicle stalk at the  
joint  of  flag  leaf  to  stalk.  These  lesions  usually  extend  downwards  beneath  the  
sheath resulting in severe wet rotting (Fig. 13.10b) and appearance of greyish myce- 
lial growth (Sunder et al. 2005). 

13.3.5.4      Pathogen 

The fungus  Drechslera oryzae Subr. and Jain (syn.  Bipolaris oryzae Shoemaker,  
Helminthosporium oryzae Breda de Haan) [telemorph:  Cochliobolus miyabeanus  
(Ito  and  Kuribayashi)  Drechsler  ex  Dastur  =  Ophiobolus  miyabeanus  Ito  and  
Kuribayashi] produces grey to olive or black, inter- and intracellular mycelium. The  
sporophores  are  thick,  erect,  geniculate,  dark  olivaceous  at  the  base  and  lighter  
towards the tip. Conidia are brownish, 5–10 septate, slightly curved, widest at the  
middle with the oldest conidium towards the base. The sizes of conidiophores and  
conidia vary from 68 to 688 × 4–20 μm and 15–170 × 7–26 μm, respectively, in dif- 
ferent countries (Ou  1985). Perithecia of the fungus are globose to depressed glo- 
bose,  with  the  outer  wall  dark  yellowish  brown  and  pseudoparenchymatous  and  
560–950 × 368–377 μm in dimensions. The asci are cylindrical to long, fusiform,  
 142–235 × 21–36 μm and contain filamentous or long cylindrical, hyaline or pale  
olive-green, 6–15 septate ascospores measuring 250–469 × 6–9 μm (Ou  1985).

13.3.5.5     Disease Cycle and Epidemiology 

The fungus surviving in soil and infected plant parts including stubbles, straw and  
grains acts as primary source of inoculum. Many plant species including Cynodon  
dactylon, Digitaria sanguinalis, Echinochloa colona, E. frumentacea, Euchlaena  
mexicana,  Imperata  spp.,  Leersia  hexandra,  Panicum  miliare,  P.  miliaceum,  
Pennisetum typhoides, Saccharum officinarum, Zizania latifolia and some wild rice  
including  Oryza coarctata, O. granulate, O. malampuzhensis, O. latifolia, O. rid- 
leyi, O. perennis, O. fatua, O. jeyporensis, O. montana and Zizania aquatica have  
been reported to be infected by the pathogen under natural or artificial inoculation  
conditions (Gangopadhyay 1983; Ou 1985; Sunder et al. 2014a). Some of the work- 
ers reported cross pathogenicity as isolates of H. oryzae from wheat, oat, Echinochloa  
phyllopogon  and  Phragmites  australis  attacked  rice  and  a  rice  isolate  attacked  
maize,  sorghum,  oats,  barley  and  sugarcane  (Sunder  et  al.  2014a).  The  primary  
infection is usually initiated by the infected seed as necrotic lesions on coleoptile  
and sheath of first leaves. The subsequent lesions on leaves arise from secondary  
infection by airborne spores produced on primary lesions (Ou  1985). 
    The disease is aggravated by prolonged leaf wetness, high soil pH, late planting,  
nutritional imbalances especially low levels of N, K, Mn, Si, free Fe, low CEC and  
low organic matter. It has been observed that NO  induces greater susceptibility than 3 
NH  (Ou  1985; Datnoff et al. 1992).4 

13.3.5.6     Disease Management 

Host Plant Resistance        Partial to complete resistance to brown spot pathogen has  
been identified in several genotypes including HRC 726, HRC 7288, NIC 105703,  
NIC 105784 and NIC 1105815 (Shukla et al.  1995) and BPT 1788, MTU 1067 and  
Swarnadhan (Sunder et al.  2005) under field conditions, and some of these lines  
may be used as donors for brown spot resistance breeding programme. Resistance  
to brown spot is known to vary with crop stage (Omar et al. 1979). Sato et al. (2008)  
identified three QTLs, viz. qBS 2, qBS 9 and qBS 11, on chromosomes 2, 9 and 11  
for brown spot resistance in rice cultivar Tadukan, while Katara et al. (2010) identi- 
fied 10 QTLs associated with brown spot resistance, some of which may be com- 
mon to those of Sato et al. (2008). 

Chemical Control        Seed treatment with various chemicals like organomercurials,  
triforine, bitertanol, pyroquilon, tricyclazole, chlorothalonil, quinolate, edifenphos,  
carbendazim, benomyl, mancozeb, thiram and captan is quite effective against H.  
oryzae in different parts of the world (Sunder et al. 2014a). Seed soaking in 2-methyl  
 1,4-naphthaquinone (vitamin K ), Na-pentachlorophenate, boric acid and β-indole 3 
acetic  acid  and  seedling  treatment  with  sulphanilamide  and  griseofulvin  signifi- 
cantly reduced disease severity. Foliar application of many chemicals, viz. manco- 
zeb,  Ridomil  MZ,  edifenphos,  iprobenphos,  iprodione,  chlorothalonil,  bitoxazol,  
propiconazole,     hexaconazole,      tebuconazole,     Sisthane,   Shin-mel,     triphenyltin

hydroxide, thiophanate-methyl, Antracol, azoxystrobin, trifloxystrobin + propicon- 
azole, difenoconazole + propiconazole and antibiotics like blasticidin SM, aureo- 
fungin, mycobacillin and versicolin, is highly effective against brown spot. Among  
these, propiconazole, hexaconazole and mancozeb are commonly used against both  
leaf spot and stalk rot phases of the disease (Ou  1985; Sunder et al. 2014a). 

Biological Control and Use of Botanicals          Strains of Pseudomonas fluorescens,  
Bacillus megaterium, B. subtilis, Trichoderma viride, T. pseudokoningii, T. harzia- 
num,  T.  reesei,  Cladosporium  spp.,  Penicillium  spp.  and  Aspergillus  flavus  are  
known to inhibit the growth of H. oryzae and to reduce the disease incidence in field  
experiments  (Sunder  et  al.  2014a). Among  various  botanicals  and  biopesticides,  
foliar application of neem cake extract, N. oleander leaf extract,  T. viride, TriCure  
(5 ml/l), Biotos (2.5 ml/l), Achook (5 ml/l), Neemazal (3 ml/l) and Wanis (5 ml/l) is  
highly effective in reducing the brown spot severity (Harish et al. 2008; Kumar and  
Rai 2008; Sunder et al. 2010). Besides, spraying with nonconventional chemicals  
like ferric chloride, sodium selenate, nickel nitrate, benzoic acid and salicylic acid  
can also induce resistance and reduce the disease severity significantly (Shabana  
et al. 2008; de Vleesschauwer et al. 2010; Sunder et al. 2010). 

13.3.6       Sheath Rot 

13.3.6.1     History and Geographical Distribution 

Sheath rot is prevalent in most of the rice-growing countries worldwide, particularly  
in rain-fed rice ecosystems, and is more prevalent during wet than dry seasons. The  
disease  has  been  reported  from  different  countries  of Asia  (Sri  Lanka,  Pakistan,  
Nepal, China, Bangladesh, Japan, Korea, India, Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines,  
Taiwan, Thailand, Vietnam and Brunei), Africa (Kenya, Nigeria, Gambia, Cameroon,  
Cote d’Ivoire, Niger, Burundi, Tanzania and Madagascar), Americas (the United  
States,  Mexico,  Cuba,  Colombia,  Venezuela,  Peru,  Brazil  and  Argentina)  and  
Australia  (Suparyono  1990;  Webster  and  Gunnell  1992;  Gill  et  al.  1993;  www. 
plantwise.org). The disease has also been described as ‘rice abortion disease’ in  
Thailand, the name given by Thai farmers (Singh and Dodan  1995). 

13.3.6.2     Economic Importance 

Sheath rot is considered to be potential threat to rice cultivation in both temperate  
and tropical regions due to severe damage and high yield losses. The extent of yield  
loss ranged from 3 to 20 % in Taiwan, 53 % in the Philippines, 85 % to almost com- 
plete loss in Thailand, 11 % in the United States and 3–90 % in India (Srinivasan  
1980; Manibhushan Rao 1996). The losses in grain yield varied significantly among  
the cultivars, but the average losses are estimated to be 15 %. The disease is also

known to affect seed germination, seedling vigour, head rice recovery, protein con- 
tent, total sugar, starch content and market value of the produce due to production  
of discoloured and shrivelled seeds (Reddy et al.  2000). Infection by rice tungro  
virus enhanced yield losses due to sheath rot (Singh and Dodan  1995). 

13.3.6.3      Symptoms 

The pathogen infects the crop just after flowering stage and produces oblong or  
somewhat irregular lesions, 0.5–1.5 cm long, with brown margins and grey cen- 
tres on uppermost leaf sheath that covers the panicle. As the disease advances,  
lesions  enlarge  and  coalesce  and  may  cover  most  part  of  leaf  sheath,  thereby  
retarding or aborting the panicle emergence. In case of early and severe infection,  
the panicles do not emerge and are compressed within the leaf sheath, a stage  
called ‘choking’, or emerge partially bearing discoloured and chaffy grains (Fig.  
13.11a, b). The disease is particularly devastating in CMS lines (A lines) in hybrid  
seed production and in dwarf varieties because of shortened internodes and poor  
panicle exertion. An abundant whitish powdery growth may be found inside the  
affected sheaths. A diffuse reddish brown discolouration may also be seen in the  
sheath (Fig. 13.11c). 

13.3.6.4      Pathogen 

Sheath rot is caused by several fungal and bacterial pathogens in different parts of  
the  world  (Singh  et  al.  2005).  Two  fungal  pathogens,  viz.  Sarocladium  oryzae  
(Sawada) Gams and Hawksworth and Fusarium moniliforme Sheldon, can cause  
sheath rot symptoms, Sarocladium oryzae being the most predominant. Sarocladium  
oryzae  produces  verticillate  conidiophores  with  one  to  two  appressed  whorls  of

branches. Conidia are produced on phialides, cylindrical to slightly fusiform, often  
somewhat curved, hyaline and single celled measuring 3.5–9 × 1–2.5 μm. The mor- 
phological characteristics of F. moniliforme isolates causing sheath rot are similar to  
those  described  under  foot  rot  and  bakanae.  However,  the  strains  of  Fusarium  
moniliforme causing bakanae do not induce sheath rot. 

13.3.6.5     Disease Cycle and Epidemiology 

S. oryzae survives as mycelium in the infected residue and on seeds (Singh and Raju  
1981; Singh and Mathur  1993). It also infects several weeds and cultivated hosts,  
viz. Eleusine indica, Monochoria vaginalis, Cyperus teneriffae, C. iria, C. diffor- 
mis, Echinochloa crus-galli, E. colona, Oryza rufipogon, Bambusa balcooa, B. vul- 
garis, Hymenachne spp., Leersia hexandra and Panicum walense (Singh and Dodan  
1995). Isolates of the fungus from weeds and rice have been found to be cross infec- 
tive. The pathogen infects rice through stomata or wounds and ramifies intercellu- 
larly  in  the  vascular  bundles  and  mesophyll  tissues  of  susceptible  cultivars. The  
severity of the disease is more on plants affected by various biotic and abiotic fac- 
tors like infection by rice tungro virus, rice yellow dwarf virus, stem borer, mites,  
water and nutrient stress. Generally, the disease intensity is more in late and densely  
planted fields. The conditions like moderate temperature (20–30 °C), high humidity,  
cloudy days during booting stage and occasional rainfall favoured the buildup of the  
disease. 

13.3.6.6     Disease Management 

The  disease  can  be  managed  effectively  through  integrated  programme  of  seed  
treatment, selection of resistant cultivars and foliar application of fungicides. 

Host Plant Resistance        Although the spectrum of genetic resistance to this disease  
is not very broad, many workers have reported sources of resistance to this disease.  
Generally, the dwarf varieties are more susceptible (Raychoudhuri and Purkayastha  
1980). Several workers have reported a number of rice varieties/cultures/wild rice  
accessions to be resistant or tolerant to sheath rot under natural disease infection,  
viz. ADT 36, ARC 7717, ASD 5, ASD 17, Intan, IR 26, IR 50, IR 54, IR 60, Sigadis,  
Tadukan, Tetep, Basmati-370,TOX 3145-TOC 34-2-3, TOX 3344-TOC 3-4, Zenith  
and japonica type varieties, Moroberekan, VS 99 and Oryza latifolia (Acc. 100963)  
(Singh  and  Dodan  1995;  Srinivasachary  et  al.  2002; Vivekananthan  et  al.  2006;  
Sharma et al. 2013). Nine QTLs on seven different chromosomes, viz. Chr. # 1, 2,  
4,  5,  6,  7  and  8,  have  been  identified  to  impart  resistance  to  sheath  rot  disease  
(Srinivasachary et al. 2002). 

Cultural and Biological Methods           Cultural practices like application of neem cake  
(1 t/ha), avoiding excess N, application of potassic fertilizers and foliar application  

----------------------- Page 338-----------------------

336                                                                             G.S. Laha et al. 

of zinc sulphate have been reported to reduce the disease intensity (Alagarsamy and  
Bhaskaran  1986; Singh and Dodan 1995). Foliar spraying of 5 % neem seed kernel  
extract (NSKE) twice, viz. during booting and 10 days later (Narasimhan et al. 1993),  
and gypsum (calcium sulphate) applied at 500 kg/ha, 50 % as basal and 50 % at 35  
DAT (Narasimhan et al.  1994), were also very promising in reducing the sheath rot  
incidence and increasing the grain yield. Treating the seeds with salt solution has  
been recommended to obtain clean seed and to minimize sheath rot incidence (Rajan  
1981). Practices like use of healthy and treated seeds, wider spacing (20 cm × 15 cm),  
adjustment of planting time and destruction of weeds, collateral hosts and crop resi- 
dues can greatly reduce the terminal disease intensity (Singh and Dodan 1995; Dodan  
et al. 1998). Several workers have reported effectiveness of different antagonists like  
Pseudomonas fluorescens, Azospirillum lipoferum , Trichoderma viride and  T. har- 
zianum  either  singly  or  as  consortium  (Sakthivel  and  Gnanamanicham   1987;  
Eswaramurthy et al.  1988; Sundaramoorthy et al. 2013). 

Chemical  Control        Chemical  control  has  been  practiced  in  many  places  and  
has   been   found   quite   satisfactory.   Several   chemicals   like   carbendazim,  
 tridemorph + carbendazim, benomyl, propiconazole, edifenphos, hexaconazole,  
iprobenphos, mancozeb, tebuconazole and chlorothalonil have been found to be  
promising against sheath rot (Singh and Dodan  1995; Lore et al. 2007; Sharma  
et al. 2013). Seed treatment with carbendazim at 2 g/kg of seeds or mancozeb  
75  WP  at  2.5  g/kg  can  control  the  seed-borne  inoculum.  Spraying  the  fields  
around flowering with carbendazim at 1 g/l or mancozeb 75 WP at 2.5 g/l or  
propiconazole 25 EC at 1 ml/l or hexaconazole 5 EC at 2 ml/l or thiophanate- 
methyl 70 WP at 1 g/l can substantially reduce the disease intensity (Singh and  
Dodan  1995; Dodan et al.  1996b). Foliar application of growth hormone, gib- 
berellic acid, has also been reported to reduce the disease intensity (Raychoudhuri  
and Purkayastha  1980). 

13.3.7       Stem Rot 

13.3.7.1     History and Geographical Distribution 

The disease was first reported from Italy by Cattaneo in 1876 (Ou 1985). Since then  
it is known to occur in several countries in Asia (Japan, India, Sri Lanka, Myanmar,  
Bangladesh,  Burma,  China,  Indonesia,  Vietnam,  Iran,  Iraq,  Pakistan,  Taiwan,  
Thailand  and  the  Philippines),  Europe  (Bulgaria,  France,  Portugal,  Turkey  and  
Spain), Africa (Madagascar, Mozambique, Egypt, Somalia and Kenya), Americas  
(the  United  States,  Venezuela,  Brazil,  Costa  Rica,  Colombia,  Guyana,  Panama,  
Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago and Argentina) and Australia (Ahuja and Srivastava  
1990; Garrido and Malaguti  1995; Cedeno et al.  1997; Watson and Priest  1998;  
Javan-Nikkhah et al.  1998; Aye et al. 2009).

13   Importance and Management of Rice Diseases                                                 337 

13.3.7.2      Economic Importance 

The disease is known to cause substantial quantitative and qualitative losses due to  
increased lodging, smaller panicles, production of light chalky grains and poor mill- 
ing quality particularly in waterlogged areas. Grain yield losses up to 50 %, 75 %  
and 80 % have been reported from Vietnam, the United States and the Philippines,  
respectively (Ou  1985). However, overall annual loss due to this disease has been  
estimated at 5–10 % (Krause and Webster 1973). Other estimates of grain yield loss  
include 27–30 % in Iraq (Al-Heeti and El-Bahadli 1982), 6–53 % in China (Li et al.  
1984) and 10–30 % in Australia (Cother and Nicol 1999). In India, annual losses of  
5–15 % have been estimated with a maximum of 80 % (Paracer and Luthra  1944).  
Krause and Webster (1973) observed 12–22 % yield reduction by inoculating the  
plants at different stages of crop growth. 

13.3.7.3      Symptoms 

The disease appears in the form of small irregular black lesions on the outer leaf  
sheath  near  the  water  level  at  mid-tillering  stage  (Fig.13.12a).  As  the  season  
advances, the lesions enlarge and the fungus moves inward, producing lesions on  
the inner leaf sheaths. Subsequently, the fungus infects the culms, resulting in par- 
tial or complete rotting (Fig.  13.12b) and premature lodging of the crop. Severely  
infected plants bear partially filled or unfilled grains. The infected plants can be  
easily pulled out from the soil due to rotting of crown. Dark greyish mycelium may

338                                                                             G.S. Laha et al. 

be found within the sheath and culm, which is converted into numerous small, round  
and black sclerotia near maturity. 

13.3.7.4     Pathogen 

Stem rot is caused by Magnaporthe salvinii (Catt.) Krause and Webster (conidial  
state Nakataea sigmoidea (Cav.) Hara). The fungus most commonly occurs in its  
sclerotial state, Sclerotium oryzae Catt. The perithecia of M. salvinii are dark, glo- 
bose, 250–650 μm in diameter and found embedded in leaf sheaths. Asci are cylin- 
drical, unitunicate, short stalked, 104–165 × 8.7–17.7 μm and contain eight fusiform,  
somewhat  curved,  three  septate  ascospores,  which  measure  35–65  ×  8.7  μm.  
Sclerotia are black, globose, smooth and 180–200 μm in diameter. Conidiophores  
are  dark,  upright,  septate,  100–175  ×  4–5  μm  and  bear  fusiform,  three  septate,  
curved conidia (29–40 × 10–14 μm) on pointed sterigmata. In addition to S. oryzae,  
S. hydrophilum and S. oryzae var. irregulare have also been found to be associated  
with this disease (Singh and Chand  1986). 

13.3.7.5     Disease Cycle and Epidemiology 

The sclerotia produced by the fungus play an important role in the initiation and  
spread of the disease. The overwintering sclerotia float on the surface of water dur- 
ing  various  tillage  operations,  come  in  contact  with  plants,  germinate  to  form  
appressoria/infection cushion and cause infection through leaf sheath, root and stem  
base. The role of conidia and ascospores in the spread of stem rot is not thoroughly  
understood.  The  fungus  has  also  been  found  to  infect  certain  grass  weeds  like  
Echinochloa colona, Eleusine indica, Leptochloa chinensis, Setaria pallide-fusca,  
Zizaniopsis miliacea and wild rice (Ou  1985). Disease incidence and severity have  
been observed to be directly correlated with the number of sclerotia present in the  
upper layer of the soil before planting (Krause and Webster  1973). The plants have  
been found to be more susceptible at the internode elongation stage, and the disease  
is favoured by high humidity and high temperature, nitrogenous fertilizer, dense  
planting and attack of stem borer, node blast, brown planthopper and jassids. 

13.3.7.6     Disease Management 

Stem  rot  can  be  managed  effectively  through  an  integrated  approach  of  residue  
management, proper fertilization and cultivar selection. 

Host Plant Resistance       Several workers have reported that resistance to stem rot is  
either not available or rarely found. However, under natural conditions of disease  
infection, some cultivars/cultures and wild rice accessions have shown tolerance to  
stem rot, viz. Cherno Fingo, IRBB 60, ARC 12751, ARC 12753, Jalmagna, Latisail,

13   Importance and Management of Rice Diseases                                          339 

Pankaj, Rasi, Basmati-370, Taraori Basmati, Pakistani Basmati,  O. rufipogon and  
O. nivara, in different parts of the world (Singh et al.  2010b; Sunder and Singh  
2015). Resistance to stem rot in rice has been reported to be controlled by two loci  
on chromosome 2 and chromosome 3 (Ni et al. 2001). 

Cultural and Biological Control         One of the most effective means of managing  
stem rot is by burning infested crop residue and stubble to minimize overwintering  
inoculum  though  environmental  pollution  issues  restrict  the  use  of  burning.  
Harvesting at ground level and removing the straw from the field, management of  
irrigation water by draining, allowing the soil to crack before irrigation and use of  
sieving floatation technique were found effective (Singh et al. 2010b). Winter flood- 
ing and incorporation of the residue in deeper layers are also helpful in reducing the  
carry-over of sclerotia to the following season and proved to be the best alternative  
to  burning  for  stem  rot  management  (Cintas  and  Webster  2001).  Practices  like  
delayed planting, application of burnt rice husk and mustard cakes and crop rotation  
like rice-lucerne-rice and rice-wheat-Vigna radiata-rice rotations have been found  
to be beneficial in managing the disease (Chand and Singh 1985; Singh et al. 2002b).  
Strains of the fungal antagonist like Gliocladium virens have been found to effec- 
tively  control  stem  rot  by  inhibiting  sclerotia  formation  and  reducing  sclerotial  
viability (Singh et al. 2002b; Nishant and Puri 2012). 

Chemical  Control      Though  several  chemicals  have  been  found  to  be  effective  
against stem rot, chemical control is not widely practiced for managing this disease.  
Application of chemicals like carbendazim, validamycin A, edifenphos, benomyl,  
thiophanate-methyl, difenoconazole and tricyclazole followed by foliar spray with  
antagonists like Penicillium glabrum and T. harzianum has been found to be effec- 
tive (Singh et al. 2002b; Sumitra et al. 2011; Kumar and Sunder 2015). 

13.4      Virus Diseases 

More than 30 viruses are known to infect rice globally (Abo and Fadhila  2003).  
However, yield loss could be substantial if virus infection takes place in early crop  
growth stage. Some of the important viruses in Asia are rice stripe virus, rice dwarf  
virus, rice gall dwarf virus, rice ragged stunt virus, rice grassy stunt virus, rice tran- 
sitory yellowing virus, rice black streaked dwarf virus, southern rice black streaked  
dwarf virus and rice tungro virus disease complex (RTV). Rice hoja blanca virus  
(RHBV), a member of the genus Tenuivirus, is economically important in several

13.4.1        Rice Tungro Disease (RTD)  

13.4.1.1       Distribution and Economic Importance 

‘Tungro’, which means degenerated growth in Filipino language, was first recog- 
nized  to  be  caused  by  a  leafhopper-transmitted  virus  in  1963  (Rivera  and  Ou  
1965).  However,  the  disease  is  believed  to  be  present  much  earlier  and  was  
known by different names like ‘accep na pula’ (red disease) and rice ‘cadang- 
cadang’  (yellowing)  in  the  Philippines,  ‘penyakit  merah’  (red  disease)  in  
Malaysia, ‘mentek’ disease in Indonesia and ‘yellow orange’ disease in Thailand  
(Ou 1985). The disease is widely distributed in South and Southeast Asia and has  
been  reported  from  India,  Pakistan,  Sri  Lanka,  Nepal,  Bangladesh,  Thailand,  
Laos, Vietnam, China, Japan, the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia, Indonesia and  
Papua New Guinea. Widespread cultivation of different HYVs following intro- 
duction  of  Taichung  Native  1  during  the  1960s  was  highly  conducive  for  the  
buildup  of  leafhopper  population  and  spread  of  rice  tungro  virus. A  series  of  
tungro  outbreaks  was  recorded  during  1980  to  2000  in  India,  Indonesia,  the  
Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand and Bangladesh (Azzam and Chancellor  2002;  
Bunawan et al.  2014). Muralidharan et al. (2003b) reported three epidemics of  
RTD from 1984 to 1994 in India. The disease assumed a serious proportion dur- 
ing 1981 in many parts of West Bengal (India) where an estimated 0.5 million  
tons of rice production loss was reported (Krishnaveni et al. 2009). The disease  
appeared in epidemic form in Gurdaspur and Amritsar districts of Punjab (India)  
during 1998 affecting about 0.45 million ha of rice crop (Varma et al. 1999). Dai  
and Beachy (2009) reported that RTD caused 5–10 % reduction in rice yields in  
South and Southeast Asia.

 13.4.1.2     Symptoms 

The disease results in the discolouration of leaves, stunting of plants and reduced  
tillering. The extent of stunting and discolouration depends on variety, nitrogen sta- 
tus of the crop and age of plants. Initial symptoms appear as interveinal chlorosis,  
and leaf discolouration may vary from greenish yellow to reddish brown or yellowish  
brown (Fig.  13.14a). Often the young infected leaves are pale green to light yellow,  
while the older leaves are reddish orange in colour. Generally, the infected leaves in  
japonica  cultivars show yellow shade, while indica cultivars show orange shade. The  
leaf discolouration usually starts from the tip of the leaves and may extend to the  
lower part of the leaf blade. Early infection results in non-emergence of panicles or  
partial emergence bearing chaffy and shrivelled grains. Tungro infection generally  
delays flowering and there is no uniformity in crop maturity (Fig. 13.14c). 

 13.4.1.3     Pathogen, Its Transmission and Virus-Vector Relationship 

Rice tungro disease is a composite disease caused by two unrelated viruses, viz. rice  
tungro bacilliform virus (RTBV– a member of the Caulimoviridae, dsDNA) and  
rice  tungro  spherical  virus  (RTSV–  a  member  of  Secoviridae,  positive-sense

Nephotettix virescens, vector of rice tungro virus; (c) field infected with rice tungro disease 

----------------------- Page 344-----------------------

342                                                                             G.S. Laha et al. 

ssRNA). The plants infected by RTSV alone do not show any definite symptoms.  
The  plants  infected  by  RTBV  alone  show  moderate  stunting  and  discolouration.  
However, rice plants infected with both RTBV and RTSV generally express severe  
stunting and yellowing. Rice tungro virus is exclusively transmitted (in a semiper- 
sistent manner) by green leafhoppers (Azzam and Chancellor  2002), Nephotettix  
virescens being the principal vector (Fig.  13.14b). The vector can acquire and trans- 
mit both particles together. When the vector feeds on plants infected with RTSV  
alone, it can pick up and transmit RTSV. But, when the leafhoppers are fed on rice  
plants  infected  with  RTBV  alone,  it  cannot  pick  up  RTBV  and  no  transmission  
occurs. However, when the leafhoppers first feed on RTSV-infected plants and pick  
up RTSV particles and then feed on RTBV-infected plants, they can pick up RTBV  
and transmit both the particles. 

13.4.1.4     Disease Cycle and Epidemiology 

The virus cannot survive in its vector or in seeds for a longer time. In areas with  
continuous cropping, the virus might survive from one crop to another. Infected  
ratoons and volunteer plants (seedlings and the plants that grow from seeds left in  
the field after harvest) have been shown to be the reservoirs of tungro inoculum and  
play an important role in its inter-seasonal carry-over. Several weeds, viz. Eleusine  
indica, Echinochloa colona, E. crus-galli, Leersia hexandra, Sporobolus tremulus,  
Pennisetum  typhoides,  Eragrostis  tenella,  Setaria  glauca,  Paspalum  distichum,  
Cynodon dactylon, Digitaria adscendens and Cyperus rotundus, and wild rice types  
are reported to be infected by the virus which could be a potential source of primary  
inoculum. The insect vectors, in addition to rice, feed on these weed hosts during off  
season. The spread of RTD depends on the availability of viruliferous leafhoppers  
and the susceptible hosts at the right stage. The transmission of virus under field  
conditions depends on the cultivar, plant age, microclimatic conditions, wind speed,  
meteorological  conditions  and  lunar  phases,  and  a  single  viruliferous  vector  can  
infect up to 40 plants per day (Krishnaveni et al. 2009). 

13.4.1.5     Disease Management 

The management of rice tungro disease involves deployment of resistant or tolerant  
varieties, elimination of primary sources of inoculum, vector management, seedbed  
management and cultural practices. 

Host Plant Resistance        The best way of managing the disease is through deploy- 
ment of resistant/tolerant varieties. A variety may be resistant to virus and/or vector.  
In India a number of high-yielding cultivars with resistance or tolerance to tungro  
and/or green leafhoppers have been released for commercial cultivation in specific  
rice-growing areas (Rani et al. 2008). Out of these, two varieties, viz. Vikramarya  
(IET  7302)  and  Nidhi  (IET  9994),  showed  very  high  level  of  resistance  to  the

13   Importance and Management of Rice Diseases                                                    343 

 disease. Several traditional varieties/land races like Latisail, Kataribhog, Ambemohar  
102, Pankhari 203, Utri Merah, Utri Rajapan and Tjina were found to be resistant to  
both virus and the vector, though only a few of them were genetically characterized.  
Resistance to RTSV in Utri Merah is governed by two recessive genes, viz. tsv1 and  
tsv2. Gene tsv1 is also responsible for RTSV resistance in cultivars Utri Rajapan and  
Pankhari 203 (Shahjahan et al. 1991; Ebron et al. 1994). Two lines derived from Utri  
Merah, viz. IR 69705-1-1-3-2-1 and IR 69726-116-1-3, showed resistance to rice  
tungro  disease.  Line  IR  69726-116-1-3  was  released  for  commercial  cultivation  
under the name ‘Tukad petanu’ and performed well in Bali, East Java and Lombok  
(Azzam and Chancellor 2002). One mutant line of rice variety IR 64, called MD 83,  
showed very high level of resistance to RTSV and its insect vector (Zenna et al.  
2008). Though transgenic plants expressing RTBV coat protein, polymerase, prote- 
ase and antisense RNA did not give protection against the disease, plants expressing  
coat protein genes and replicase genes of RTSV showed moderate to good level of  
resistance (Azzam and Chancellor  2002; Krishnaveni et al. 2009). RNA interfer- 
ence  (RNAi)  technology  through  the  expression  of  DNA  encoding  ORF  IV  of  
RTBV showed promise against rice tungro disease (Tyagi et al. 2008). 

Cultural Control      Practices like adjustment of sowing time to avoid peak population  
of vectors; inclusion of a non-host crop like legume, oilseed, fibre or tuber crop in  
crop rotation to interrupt the disease perpetuation and vector buildup; periodic rogu- 
ing; and removal of affected plants to reduce the inoculum source and removal of  
ratoons and self-sown plants can reduce the primary source of inoculum and disease  
spread (Krishnaveni et al. 2009). 

Chemical Control          The spread of rice tungro disease can be checked indirectly by  
controlling the vector by incorporating carbofuran 3 G at 30–35 kg/ha or phorate  
10 G at 12–15 kg/ha in rice nursery bed in top 2–5 cm layer of the soil before sow- 
ing sprouted seeds or broadcasting the recommended insecticides 4–5 days after  
sowing in a thin film of water. Foliar application of imidacloprid 200 SL at 125 ml/ 
ha  or  etofenprox  10  EC  at  750  ml/ha  or  thiamethoxam  25  WG  at  100  g/ha  or  
acephate 50 WP at 1200 g/ha or monocrotophos 36 EC at 1500 ml/ha has been rec- 
ommended for the protection of transplanted crop from RTD. 

13.4.2       Rice Yellow Mottle  

13.4.2.1      Distribution and Economic Importance 

This disease was first recorded in Kenya in 1966 (Bakker  1970). Subsequently, it  
was  reported  from  most  of  the  West,  Central  and  East  African  countries,  viz.  
Burkina  Faso,  Burundi,  Cameroon,  Central  African  Republic,  Chad,  Congo  
Democratic Republic, Cote d’Ivoire, Ethiopia, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea- 
Bissau,  Kenya,  Liberia,  Madagascar,  Malawi,  Mali,  Mauritania,  Niger,  Nigeria,  

----------------------- Page 346-----------------------

344                                                                            G.S. Laha et al. 

Rwanda, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Tanzania, Togo, Uganda and Zimbabwe. Over the  
last 20–25 years, the disease has become a major production constraint in the irri- 
gated  and  lowland  rice  ecosystems  of Africa,  especially  in  Burkina  Faso,  Cote  
d’Ivoire,  Mali,  Niger,  Senegal  and  Sierra  Leone  (Anonymous  2000;  Sere  et  al.  
2013). In some areas of Madagascar and Cote d’Ivoire, several rice fields were  
abandoned due to severe occurrence of this disease (Yoboue  1989; Reckhaus and  
Randrianangaly  1990). The disease has also been reported from some upland rice  
fields of Cote d’Ivoire and Guinea-Bissau (Kouassi et al. 2005). Grain yield loss  
due to RYMV has been reported to range from 10 to 100 % in different countries  
depending on plant age at the time of infection, level of susceptibility of the variet- 
ies and prevailing climatic conditions (Fomba  1986; Reckhaus and Adamou 1986;  
Anonymous  2000;  Kouassi  et  al.  2005).  Several  African  countries  have  faced  
highly devastating epidemics of RYMV in the past (Konate and Fargette  2003).  
Severe outbreaks of RYMV were reported from Kenya, Niger, Sierra Leone and  
Liberia (http://www.cabi.org/isc/datasheet/47658). The disease has been reported  
to cause up to 60 % yield loss in Kenya (Okhoba  1989) and between 84 and 97 %  
yield losses in Sierra Leone (Taylor  1989). 

13.4.2.2     Symptoms 

The disease results in yellow to orange discolouration of the leaves, stunting of the  
plants, reduced tillering, nonsynchronous flowering, poor panicle exertion, spikelet  
sterility, discolouration of grains and, in severe cases, even death of the plants. In the  
field, diseased plants may be observed 3–4 weeks after transplanting and are easily  
noticeable because of their yellowish appearance. The symptoms appear as small,  
yellow-green,  oblong  to  linear  spots  at  the  base  of  young  systemically  infected  
leaves which enlarge along the veins as broken or continuous streaks. The leaves  
developing later are mottled, often twisted and show difficulty in emerging. Young  
leaves are more susceptible to infection, and if the plants are infected within 20 days  
after planting, then the symptoms are very severe and plants may stop growing and  
eventually die. 

13.4.2.3     Virus and Its Transmission 

RYMV belongs to Sobemovirus group which has isometric particles (ca 30 nm in  
diameter)  with  single-stranded  linear,  positive-sense  RNA.  Many  insect  vectors,  
viz. Sesselia pusilla, Chaetocnema pulla, Trichispa sericea, Dicladispa viridicya- 
nea and grasshopper Conocephalus merumontanus, are known to transmit the virus  
(Kouassi et al.  2005). The virus is also transmitted mechanically by farm imple- 
ments, human and animal activities and plant-to-plant contact. Wind-mediated leaf-  
to- leaf  contact,  guttation  fluids  and  irrigation  water  can  also  spread  the  virus.  
However, RYMV has not been demonstrated to be seed transmitted. The disease is  
more  serious  in  transplanted  rice  than  direct  seeded  rice. Any  injury  to  the  rice

13   Importance and Management of Rice Diseases                                                     345 

plants can increase the incidence of RYMV in the fields. Sarra ( 1998) reported that  
infected rice straw left in the fields after harvest can be a potential source of RYMV. 

13.4.2.4      Epidemiology 

RYMV can infect different wild species of  Oryza and several weed species, viz.  
Eleusine indica, Eragrostis tenuifolia, E. ciliaris, Echinochloa crus-galli, Panicum  
repens, Cyperus rotundus and Imperata cylindrica. Initial infection takes place by  
the insect vectors which feed on infected wild rice, weed hosts or self-grown or  
inter-season  rice  plants  (in  lowlands),  and  the  secondary  spread  takes  place  by  
wind-mediated leaf-to-leaf contact, mechanically or through insect vectors. 

13.4.2.5      Disease Management 

The genetic resistance to RYMV has been found to be governed by a recessive gene  
rymv1. Four alleles of this resistance locus have been identified, viz. rymv1-2 (in an  
indica variety Gigante originating from Mozambique) and  rymv1-3, rymv1-4 and  
rymv1-5, from different Oryza glaberrima accessions, viz. TOG 5681, TOG 5672  
and TOG 5674, respectively (Sere et al. 2013). The alleles from O. glaberrima have  
been  incorporated  in  several  lowland  NERICA  (New  Rice  for Africa)  varieties.  
Subsequently, another recessive resistance gene, rymv2, has been identified from O.  
glaberrima (Sere et al. 2013). Recurrent backcrossing has been done to introgress  
these  genes  in  the  elite  backgrounds.  However,  because  of  the  appearance  of  
resistance- breaking strains, efforts are being made to combine two resistance genes  
in varieties for release and cultivation in hotspot areas. In addition, QTLs conferring  
partial resistance have been identified in chromosome 7 and 12 (Sere et al. 2013). 
    Controlling the insect vectors is an important aspect of managing this disease as  
vectors play an important role in transmitting RYMV from surrounding infected  
rice or weed plants. The destruction of virus reservoirs by burning during the dry  
season, removal of rice regrowths and the use of chemical treatment against insect  
vectors can dramatically reduce primary and secondary infections. 

13.4.3       Rice Hoja Blanca  

13.4.3.1      Distribution and Economic Importance 

Rice hoja blanca virus (white leaf, RHBV) is the most important viral disease of  
rice  in  Latin America.  Though  the  disease  gained  importance  only  since  1957  
when  it  broke  out  in  threatening  form  in  Florida  in  Southeastern  United  States  
(Atkins  and  Adair  1957),  it  was  first  recorded  in  Colombia  as  early  as  1935  
(Garces-Orejuela  et  al.  1958).  Gradually  the  disease  was  spread  to  different  

----------------------- Page 348-----------------------

346                                                                            G.S. Laha et al. 

countries in Central America, the Caribbean region and South America. Presently,  
the disease is widely distributed throughout tropical and subtropical America, viz.  
Brazil, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela, French Guiana, Guyana and Suriname  
in  South  America;  Nicaragua,  Panama,  Costa  Rica,  El  Salvador,  Guatemala,  
Honduras and Belize in Central America; and the United States, Mexico, Puerto  
Rico,  Cuba  and  Dominican  Republic  in  North America  (Morales  and  Jennings  
2010). The disease can cause a significant yield loss ranging from 25 to 75 % in  
susceptible cultivars due to seedling death, reduced photosynthesis, growth retar- 
dation and panicle sterility (Jennings  1963; Morales and Jennings 2010). 

13.4.3.2     Symptoms 

The disease appears as chlorotic streaks on the leaves which coalesce turning the leaves  
yellow or whitish. The succeeding leaves are either almost entirely white or mottled. If  
the infection takes place in early growth stages, then the plants become stunted, and in  
severe cases, the leaves turn necrotic and plants die. The disease affects the growth and  
emergence of the panicles and results in poor or partial filling and discolouration of the  
grains. Infection by this virus also predisposes the plants to brown spot. 

13.4.3.3     Virus and Its Transmission 

RHBV is a member of the genus Tenuivirus and is closely related to other tenuivi- 
ruses  found  in America  like  Echinochloa  hoja  blanca  virus  and  Urochloa  hoja  
blanca virus. The ssRNA genome of Tenuivirus consists of four or more segments.  
The RHBV genome has four visible ssRNA species. The RNA-1 is generally of  
negative polarity, whereas others (RNAs 2–4) have ambisense translation strategy.  
RHBV is transmitted by leafhopper Tagosodes orizicolus which is the main vector  
and also by T. cubanus which is a minor vector. The vector acquires the virus while  
feeding on the infected plants, and there is a period of 17–22 days of viral propaga- 
tion before the planthoppers become viruliferous (Galvez 1968; Webber et al. 1971).  
There is a high rate of transovarian transmission to the progeny, and the nymphs can  
transmit the virus soon after they emerge. The virus however cannot be transmitted  
mechanically.  Many  cultivated  crops  like  wheat,  barley,  oats  and  rye  and  weeds  
such as Echinochloa colona are susceptible to RHBV both naturally and under arti- 
ficial inoculation (Morales and Jennings 2010). 

13.4.3.4     Epidemiology 

The disease epidemics show cyclic and erratic pattern. The disease caused signifi- 
cant loss (25–50 %) during 1957–1964, 1981–1984 and 1996–1999 in Colombia  
(Morales and Jennings  2010). Genetic resistance of the vectors to the virus, low

13   Importance and Management of Rice Diseases                                          347 

proportion of the viruliferous insect population (15–25 %) and low fecundity of the  
RHBV-infected planthoppers are the probable factors for cyclic and erratic nature of  
the RHBV epidemics (Zeigler and Morales  1990). 

13.4.3.5     Disease Management 

Initial works using japonicas from Taiwan and other sources resulted in the develop- 
ment  of  several  RHBV-resistant  lines  like  Napal,  CICA7  and  Colombia  1.  
Subsequently, two varieties, viz. Oryzica-1 and Metica-1, possessing tolerance to  
RHBV were developed using Colombia 1 (Munoz and Garcia  1983). The cultivars  
like Lacrose, Gulfrose l, Tainan-iku No. 487, Pandhori No. 4 and others have been  
used  in  resistance  breeding  programme  (Morales  and  Jennings  2010).  Work  at  
CIAT, Colombia and IRD, Montpellier, France, revealed a high-level resistance in  
two indica varieties Fedearroz 2000 (Fd 2000) and Fedearroz 50 (Fd 50) to RHBV  
and its vector T. orizicolus. Further genetic analysis revealed a major QTL on chro- 
mosome 4 in both the varieties explaining about 50 % resistance against RHBV. In  
addition, one QTL in Fd 2000 on chromosome 5 and another QTL in Fd 50 on  
chromosome 7 were identified conferring resistance to vector T. orizicolus (Romero  
et al. 2014). The resistance QTL has been mapped and is being introgressed in elite  
rice varieties. 
   Removal of volunteer or ratoon rice plants in fields prior to sowing or transplant- 
ing of the rice crop can reduce the intensity of the disease in the fields. Crop rotation  
involving a nonhost crop can reduce the initial inocula and the disease severity. The  
disease  can  also  be  significantly  managed  by  controlling  the  vectors.  However,  
chemical sprayings for insect vector control led to the resurgence of the vector and  
high incidence of the disease in Ecuador and Colombia (Buddenhagen  1983). 

13.5      Conclusion 

There is no silver bullet for management of all the rice diseases in the field. An  
integrated  management  approach  has  a  fair  chance  of  success  in  the  field  as  
effectiveness of most of the components of such a method has been identified  
individually. It would specifically revolve around the use of an appropriate resis- 
tant or tolerant variety and a few simple practices for which there are experimen- 
tal evidences that they can reduce the disease severity individually. These include  
use  of  healthy  seeds,  seed  treatment,  removal  of  primary  inoculum,  avoiding  
flooding of the fields, avoiding excess nitrogen and applying nitrogen fertilizer  
in  splits  and  need-based  application  of  chemicals.  Regular  surveillance  of  the  
fields and adoption of the available control measures will certainly help in keep- 
ing the diseases below their economic threshold level and in enhancing the rice  
production.

Rice Weeds and Their Management 

Vivek Kumar, Gulshan Mahajan, and Bhagirath S. Chauhan 

14.1       Introduction 

Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is a major staple food not only for the people of Asia but for  
the whole world. In the economic and social stability of the world, rice plays an  
important role as more than 50 % population of the world consider it as a major  
staple food. Weeds are the most important biological constraints in the way to attain  
the potential rice yield because of their ability to compete for resources and their  
impact on rice quality. Heavy rice yield losses can be expected from weeds, and in  
the extreme conditions there can be complete crop loss (Ni et al. 2000; Rao et al.  
2007; Jabran et al. 2012a, b; Jabran and Chauhan 2015). Losses caused by weeds  
further depend upon the method of rice establishment. In the absence of effective  
weed control options, yield losses are greater in direct-seeded rice (DSR) than in  
transplanted  rice  (Mahajan  et  al.  2009).  In  transplanted  rice,  the  initial  flush  of  
weeds is controlled by flooding. Besides this, in the DSR method, the emerging rice  
seedlings  are  less  competitive  with  concurrently  emerging  weeds  (Kumar  et  al.  
2008;  Rao  et  al.  2007).  It  is  imperative  that  investment  in  weed  management  
 practices be made to reduce yield losses caused by weeds. Total losses caused by

weeds are tied up with cultural practices pertaining to weed control, land  preparation,  
weed control expenses, and reduction in yield quantity and quality. 

 14.2     Important Rice Weeds 

There are different ecosystems in which rice is cultivated, i.e., irrigated, shallow  
lowlands,  mid-deep  lands,  deep  water,  and  uplands.  In  these  different  ecosys- 
tems, different types of weed species are found (Singh and Singh 2008). With the  
change in the surface hydrology and rice establishment method, changes in weed  
flora have been reported. Ho ( 1991) observed the changes in the weed flora with  
the  use  of  the  direct-seeding  method  of  rice.  By  the  adoption  of  dry  and  wet  
direct sowing methods of rice, the floristic diversity increased and a change in the  
relative dominance of the major weed species occurred in comparison with the  
transplanting  method.  The  dominating  weed  species  of  transplanted  rice  are  
Monochoria  vaginalis  (Burm.  f.)  C.  Presl.,  Ludwigia  hyssopifolia  (G.  Don)  
Exell,  Fimbristylis  miliacea  (L.) Vahl,  Cyperus  difformis  L.,  and  Limnocharis  
flava   (L.)  Buch.  However,  in  dry-seeded  rice,  Echinochloa  colona  (L.)  Link.,  
Echinochloa crus-galli (L.) P. Beauv., Leptochloa chinensis (L.) Nees,  Scirpus  
grossus L.f., and F. miliacea are dominating weeds, while in wet-seeded rice, E.  
crus-galli, L. chinensis, F. miliacea, Marsilea crenata C. Presl, and Monochoria  
vaginalis are the dominating weeds. Information regarding the weed flora in rice  
has been presented in Table  14.1. 

 14.3     Yield Losses by Weeds in Rice 

Yield losses by weeds are largely dependent on the season, weed species, weed  
density, rice cultivar, growth rate, management practice, and rice ecosystem. The  
extent of losses caused by weeds can be ascertained with the following examples.  
Globally, actual yield losses due to pests have been estimated to be ~40 %, and  
the highest share of this loss (32 %) is caused by weeds only (Rao et al. 2007).  
Rao and Moody ( 1994) found that in uncontrolled conditions, weeds caused rice  
grain yield losses ranging from 36 to 56 % in the Philippines. Similarly, yield  
losses by weeds in uncontrolled conditions were recorded from 40 to 100 % in  
South Korea (Kim and Ha 2005). In India, rice yield losses caused by weeds were  
observed  at  about  33  %  by  Mukherjee  (2004)  and  32–83  %  by  Savary  et  al.  
 (1997),  while  in  Sri  Lanka,  weeds  accounted  for  30–40  %  of  yield  losses  
 (Abeysekera  2001).  Zhang  (2005)  found  that  rice  yield  reduction  caused  by  
weeds is 10–20 % in China, while Azmi ( 1992) estimated the average rice yield  
losses due to weeds between 10 and 35 % in Malaysia. More than 70 % reduction  
in  rice  grain  yield  was  noted  to  be  caused  by  uncontrolled  weeds  in  Pakistan  
 (Jabran  et  al.  2012a).  In  Bangladesh,  rice  yield  losses  due  to  weeds  were

estimated at 70–80 % in Au s rice (early summer), 30–40 % in transplanted Aman  
rice (late summer), and 22–36 % in Boro rice (winter rice) (BRRI 2006). Oerke  
and Dehne (2004) reported 10 % total yield losses due to weeds in world rice  
production. Similarly, Oerke (2006) reported that 10 and 37 % actual and poten- 
tial yield losses, respectively, are caused by weeds in rice all across the world. In  
Sub-Saharan Africa, weeds inflicted yield losses in rice, despite control, in the  
range of 15–23 % and are conservatively estimated to add up to 2.2 million tons  
per year, equating to approximately half the current total imports of rice to this  
region (Rodenburg and Johnson 2009). 
    Yield losses caused by grasses (mainly E. crus-galli), broadleaved weeds, and sedges  
were 41, 28, and 10 %, respectively (Azmi and Baki  1995). Azmi and Rezaul (2008)  
found that weedy rice (Oryza sativa f. spontanea) is difficult to harvest and it reduces  
yield as it matures earlier than cultivated rice, and it shatters and lodges easily. Azmi and  
Abdullah (1998) estimated that weedy rice at 35 % infestation can cause yield losses of  
about 60 %, and under serious infestation, yield losses can be as high as 74 % in DSR. 
    Yield losses in rice due to weeds are presented in Table 14.2. Yield reduction due  
to weeds is more critical in DSR than in transplanted rice (Karim et al.  2004). If  
weeds were not controlled, the yield reduction in transplanted rice was found to be  
13–63 %, while in DSR, it was recorded as 50–91 % (Singh et al. 2005a; Rao et al.  
2007; Azmi 1992).

14.4        Herbicide Resistance in Weeds 

In the modern agriculture, herbicides have a vital role in weed management. The role  
of herbicides is even more determined in case of aerobic rice system as other methods  
become less effective and weed infestation is increased in this method. However, with  
the recurrent use of herbicides, selection and infestation of herbicide- resistant weeds  
has become a very serious problem. With the continuous selection pressure, many her- 
bicide-resistant weed species have been evolved in rice systems (Fischer et al. 2000).  
The mechanisms of herbicide resistance are grouped into two types: target site-based  
resistance and nontarget site-based resistance. Target site- based resistance is caused by  
the alteration of herbicide target sites. While nontarget site-based resistance includes  
other resistance mechanisms such as enhanced herbicide metabolism, enhanced herbi- 
cide sequestration, and reduced herbicide uptake (Powles and Yu 2010). 
    A recent report indicated that 48 weed species occurring in the rice crop have evolved  
resistance against various herbicides (Heap 2016). Acetolactate synthase (ALS) inhibi- 
tor resistance has been the most prevalent form of resistance in rice weeds. Major rice  
weeds that have developed ALS inhibitor resistance against different herbicides are S.  
montevidensis,  Alisma  plantago-aquatica  L.,  E.  crus-galli,  and  C.  difformis  (Heap  
2016). After a few years of overuse and misuse of phenoxy (2,4-D) and sulfonylurea  
herbicides in aerobic rice systems, several weed species such as S. zeylanica, M. minuta,  
and F. miliacea have evolved resistance against these herbicides in Thailand, Malaysia,  
and Vietnam (Azmi et al. 2005). Similarly, Echinochloa oryzoides (Ard.) Fritsch and  
Echinochloa  phyllopogon  (Stapf)  Vasc.  have  evolved  resistance  against  bispyribac- 
sodium, molinate, fenoxaprop-ethyl, and thiobencarb in California (Fischer et al. 2000)  
and E. crus-galli against propanil, quinclorac, and clomazone in the state of Arkansas in  
Southern United States (Bagavathiannan et al. 2011; Talbert and Burgos 2007). 
    These herbicide-resistant weeds pose a major challenge to the rice growers by reduc- 
ing yields and increasing production costs (Fischer et al. 2000; Fischer and Hill 2004).  
So, in the situation of increasing herbicide resistance cases, there is a need to adopt  
integrated weed management strategies for managing these herbicide- resistant weeds. It  
may help to avoid or delay the evolution of resistance in weeds against herbicides. 

14.5        Control Methods 

Weed control methods can be grouped into preventive, cultural, physical, chemical,  
and biological techniques. 

14.5.1       Preventive Measures  

Prevention of weed introduction and spread is the most important strategy in man- 
aging weeds (Buhler 2002) regardless of crop, establishment method, and ecosys- 
tem. There are many sources like crop seed, irrigation channels, machinery, etc.,  

----------------------- Page 370-----------------------

368                                                                           V. Kumar et al. 

which  cause  the  introduction  and  spread  of  weeds  from  one  area  to  another.  
Preventive measures should be adopted including the use of weed-free seeds, main- 
taining  clean  fields,  borders,  and  irrigation  canals,  and  cleaning  farm  equipment  
before moving them from one field to another (De Datta and Baltazar  1996). Thus,  
prevention involves all those measures that restrict the entry and establishment of  
weeds in an area. There are many examples of introduction of obnoxious weeds in  
the lack of preventive measures. Weedy rice is such an example, which has spread  
in  many Asian  countries  through  contaminated  rice  seeds  (Chauhan  2013b)  and  
now it has become a major issue because there is no such selective herbicide that  
can control weedy rice in conventional rice cultivars. 
   In recent years, preventive measures have been de-emphasized due to herbicide  
availability. However, in situations like presence of herbicide-resistant weed bio- 
types  and  difficult-to-control  weeds,  preventive  measures  become  important  and  
play an effective role in weed control (Buhler 2002). Prevention implemented at the  
community level by enforcement of laws and regulation provides reasonable weed  
control. 

14.5.2       Cultural Measures 

14.5.2.1     Stale Seedbed Technique 

Stale or false seedbed technique is an effective weed management technique where a  
crop faces heavy weed infestation in initial stages of growth. In this technique, soil  
preparation is done a few weeks before the actual sowing of crop to promote the  
germination of weeds. This causes the depletion of seed bank in the surface layer of  
soil and thus reduction of subsequent emergence of weeds (Rao et al. 2007). After the  
emergence of weeds, these are killed either by chemical methods (nonselective her- 
bicide) or by mechanical methods (like shallow tillage) before the sowing of rice. 
   Under this technique, emerging weed seedlings are killed mostly with herbicides  
(Oliver et al.  1993). However, stale seedbed can also be implemented by submerg- 
ing the weed seedlings under water for 10 days, after the stale seedbed period of 7  
and 14 days of weed emergence (Sindhu et al. 2010). Singh et al. (2009) reported  
that  after  stale  seedbed  practices  in  DSR,  a  53  %  lower  weed  population  was  
observed. Delouche et al. (2007) and Rao et al. (2007) also recommended the stale  
seedbed technique to control weedy rice in zero-till DSR where there are limited  
options available to manage this weed. 

14.5.2.2     Land Preparation/Tillage Systems 

Land preparation or tillage systems play an important role in rice cultivation, especially  
in DSR and can be used as an effective way of controlling weeds, thereby decreasing  
cost and increasing profit. Tillage practices mainly have two objectives: one is to uproot

14   Rice Weeds and Their Management                                                        369 

the weeds growing in the field and second is to prepare the land to create favorable  
conditions for the crop seed to germinate. Vertical weed seed distribution in the soil is  
influenced differently by different tillage systems and the relative abundance of differ- 
ent weed species in the field is the result of this distribution of weed seed in the soil  
(Chauhan and Johnson 2009). For instance, most of the weed seeds are left near the soil  
surface after planting in zero-tillage systems. This provides favorable conditions for  
germination of weed seeds present on the soil surface. On the other hand, in conven- 
tional tillage systems, weed seeds present on the soil surface are buried too deep that  
may not be able to emerge. However, it is also a fact that weed seeds are more prone to  
rapid desiccation and predation in case of zero tillage as compared to conventional  
systems. 
   It  has  reported  in  several  studies  that  weed  biomass  and  weed  density  were  
higher in zero tillage system as compared to conventional tillage system, which  
caused higher grain yield in conventional tillage plots as compared to zero tillage  
(Fig. 14.1) (Chauhan 2013a, b; Singh et al. 2015). Tillage practices affect the weed  
abundance not only in the present crop but also in the succeeding crop. Singh et al.  
(2005a, b) have shown that different tillage practices in wheat selectively alter the  
relative abundance of grass and sedge weeds in succeeding rice crops. 
   There is no doubt that tillage practices can be used as an important tool of weed  
management and any reduction in tillage practices can cause the increase in weed  
problems (Shrestha et al. 2005). However, tillage cannot be used as an ultimate tool  
for  weed  management.  It  can  serve  only  as  a  temporary  means  of  weed  control  
because on one hand it buries the weed seed in the deep layers which cannot emerge  
but on the other hand it bring the buried seeds to the surface layer also, thus provide  
a favorable environment for their germination (Chauhan and Johnson 2010a, b).

14.5.2.3     Crop Establishment Method 

Different crop establishment methods have been introduced for rice cultivation like  
transplanting,  dry  direct  seeding,  wet  direct  seeding,  and  water  seeding.  These  
methods cause the differences in weed flora of the fields. As compared to the con- 
ventional transplanting method, weed control is particularly challenging in DSR  
systems because of the diversity and severity of weed infestation, and the absence  
of standing water layer to suppress weeds at the time of rice emergence. Besides  
this, in DSR, plants cannot take seedling size advantage over the weed seedlings as  
in the transplanting system, because both rice and weeds emerge simultaneously in  
DSR systems. Weed seed distribution in the soil profile is influenced by land prepa- 
ration practices in DSR systems, thus there is abundance of weed species compared  
to the transplanted method (Chauhan and Opeña 2012). 
   In conventional-till DSR systems, a large number of perennial species (P. disti- 
chum,  C. dactylon, and  C. rotundus) and annual grasses (I. rugosum) and annual  
sedges (C. difformis and F. miliacea) dominate (Timsina et al. 2010). However, in  
the zero-till DSR system, less growth of perennial weeds (C. dactylon, P. distichum,  
and C. rotundus) and annual weeds (I. rugosum and F. miliacea) was observed com- 
pared with the conventional-till DSR system. Therefore, crop establishment meth- 
ods can be used as an effective tool in weed management in rice. Chauhan et al.  
(2015) reported that grass weeds were higher in dry-seeded rice compared to pud- 
dled transplanted rice (PTR) and nonpuddled transplanted rice. The highest total  
weed density (225–256 plants m−2) and total weed biomass (315–501 g m−2) were  
recorded in dry-seeded rice, while the lowest (102–129 plants m−2 and 75–387 g m−2)  

in PTR. Chhokar et al. (2014) also found the highest yield and least weed abundance  
in the PTR. Compared to the transplanting rice, severe weed infestation was found  
in the dry and wet DSR and thus lesser yield was found in DSR compared to trans- 
planting rice both in the presence and absence of weeds. The yield losses due to  
weeds in the DSR treatments ranged from 91.4 to 99.0 %, compared to 16.0 and  
42.0 % in the transplanting treatments. Weeds, including C. rotundus, D. aegyptium,  
Digera arvensis Forsk., Phyllanthus niruri L., and  T. portulacastrum, which were  
present in the unpuddled DSR treatments, were not found in the puddled plots, par- 
ticularly the puddled transplanting treatments. 
   In a rice–chickpea system, the density of E. colona was reported higher, while  
that of  C. iria was lower under puddled broadcast compared to transplanted rice,  
DSR, and zero till-DSR. Due to higher plant population of rice and better weeds  
suppression, the lowest weed dry weight was observed in puddled broadcast rice  
(Mishra et al. 2012). Thus, the choice of appropriate crop establishment technique  
is an important step toward integrated weed management in rice culture. 

14.5.2.4     Seeding Rate and Planting Geometry 

Cultural weed management approaches mainly focus on the reduction of the effects  
of weeds on the crop either by making weeds less competitive or by making the crop  
more competitive (Gibson et al. 2002). Increased seeding rates and altered planting

geometry can be used to improve crop competitiveness and thus can be proved an  
effective component of weed management strategies. In cereals, altered planting  
density and geometry have been proposed and tested as a component of weed man- 
agement strategies (Kristensen et al. 2008). Crop competitiveness against weeds is  
increased by increasing the crop density through narrowing row spacing (Chauhan  
and Johnson  2010a). Solar radiation interception, canopy coverage, and biomass  
accumulation are determined by the planting density of a crop, which have cumula- 
tive effect on its weed suppressive ability (Anwar et al. 2011). 
   Weed suppressing ability of a crop is increased by increasing planting density of  
the  crop  that  develops  canopy  rapidly  and  consequently  suppresses  weeds  more  
effectively (Guillermo et al. 2009). However, widely spaced plants encourage weed  
growth. Ni et al. (2004) and Phuong et al. (2005) reported that in the presence of  
weeds, the highest yields in DSR could be expected where crop plant densities and  
spatial uniformity were greater. Narrow plant-to-plant spacing (10 cm) significantly  
reduced  weed  biomass  compared  with  the  wider  plant-to-plant  spacing  (20  cm)  
(Chauhan and Opeña 2013a, b). Compared with the 20 cm spacing, the plots with  
10 cm spacing had 27–37 % lower weed biomass. Zhao et al. (2007) reported that  
weed biomass was decreased and yield of aerobic rice increased with increasing the  
seed rate from 100 to 300 viable seeds m−2 . Reduction in weed biomass by 40 and  

58 % in two consecutive years has been reported with increased seeding rate from  
25 to 100 kg ha−1 (Chauhan et al.  2011). Gaanie et al. (2014) also found that the  

increase in seed rate resulted in a significant decrease in the total weed density and  
total weed biomass at all the stages of crop growth. With increase in seed rate, the  
number of crop plants per unit area was higher, giving them competitive advantage  
over existing weeds. Increase in rice seed rate from 10 to 32.5 kg ha−1 resulted in  

decrease  in  weed  density  and  weed  biomass  but  the  rice  yield  increase  beyond  
17.5 kg ha−1 seed rate was nonsignificant. 

    Chauhan and Abugho (2013) also found in a pot experiment that growth and  
reproduction of E. crus-galli was reduced with increasing the seeding rate. Thus it  
was suggested that increasing seeding rates can be used as a weed management tool  
in both low- and high-input farming systems. However, complete weed control can- 
not be achieved by crop interference alone. So, it should not be considered as a  
stand-alone strategy to manage weeds in rice. However, it can be used as an integral  
part of different weed management strategies to achieve complete control of weeds  
in rice. 

14.5.2.5     Weed Competitive Cultivars 

Generally, rice is considered a weak competitor against weeds compared to taller  
crops such as maize (Saito et al. 2010a). However, variation among cultivars in their  
ability to suppress weeds has been documented for rice (Gibson and Fischer 2004;  
Zhao  2006). Besides, superior weed competitive rice varieties can be developed.  
Development of such cultivars with enhanced competitiveness against weeds could  
be  more  acceptable  by  rice  farmers  and  could  help  to  reduce  dependency  on  
herbicides.

372                                                                              V. Kumar et al. 

    There are two main components of crop–weed competitiveness. These are weed  
tolerance and weed-suppressive ability (Jannink et al. 2000). Weed tolerance is the  
ability of a crop to maintain high yield despite weed competition, whereas weed-  
suppressive ability is the ability of the plant to suppress weed growth and reduce  
weed seed production, thus improving weed management in both the current and  
the subsequent growing seasons. Because yield stability and the prevention of weed  
seed production and subsequent seed bank build-up are desirable in crops growing  
in association with weeds, so both the components are important while considering  
crop–weed competitiveness (Jordan  1993). 
    Ideal weed competitive rice varieties should have strong weed-suppressive abil- 
ity and high yielding under both weed-free and weedy conditions. Weed biomass is  
assessed under weedy conditions to determine the weed suppressing ability of a  
crop (Saito et al. 2010b). This approach of weed management that utilizes the sup- 
pressing ability of cultivars to control weeds is referred to as the genetic approach  
of weed management. The role of competitive cultivars can be exploited further  
with the manipulations in the agronomic practices such as altered planting geometry  
and sowing time that can be proved helpful in providing supplemental weed control  
in case of no or less use of herbicides (Mahajan and Chauhan 2011). 
    Several traits confer weed competitiveness in rice (Mahajan and Chauhan 2013a).  
These  are  plant  height  (Mennan  et  al.  2012),  tiller  number  (Harding  and  Jalloh  
2011; Mennan et al. 2012), biomass at tillering (Ni et al.  2000), leaf area index  
(Moukoumbi et al. 2011; Harding and Jalloh 2011), canopy cover (Lotz et al. 1995),  
specific leaf area (Moukoumbi et al. 2011), root growth (Gibson et al. 1999; Fofana  
and Rauber 2000), early seedling vigor (Zhao et al. 2006), and seedling leaf area  
and biomass (Namuco et al. 2009). Fischer et al. (1997) observed that the competi- 
tive ability of rice against E. colona was correlated more with rice tillering and leaf  
area than with plant height. 
    Previous  studies  have  shown  significant  differences  in  competitiveness  among  
rice genotypes. Mennan et al. (2012) reported that among different rice cultivars (viz.  
Osmancık, Kızılırmak, Karadeniz, Koral, and Neĝis), Koral produced significantly  
more tillers than the other cultivars irrespective of E. crus-galli densities and reduced  
E. crus-galli tiller production by about 30 and 16 % at two locations. This cultivar  
showed  the  highest  competitiveness  because  of  its  high  biomass  accumulation  in  
early growth stages and smaller reductions in plant height in the presence of E. crus- 
galli, compared to the other cultivars. Among different rice varieties, NERICA L19,  
NERICA L20, and WAS 57-B-B-17-3-3-6-TGR 20 showed encouraging responses  
and appeared competitive enough against weeds with better growth, yield, and yield  
components (Harding and Jalloh 2013). The range of weed biomass production was  
           −2                                  −2 
12.3 g m     in NERICA L19 to 44.7 g m            in ROK 10. Yield advantages have been  
shown by cultivars of the African rice species Oryza glaberrima over the Asian  O.  
sativa varieties under weedy conditions (Johnson et al.  1998). In other regions also,  
varieties with superior levels of weed competitiveness have been confirmed, such as  
Apo  and  UPLRi-7  in Asia  (Zhao  et  al.  2006,  2007),  Oryzica  Sabana  6  in  Latin  
America (Fischer et al.  2001), and M-202 in North America (Gibson et al.  2001).  
Some O. sativa, O. glaberrima, and interspecific rice varieties that have shown to be  
weed competitiveness type in Africa, have been listed in Table  14.3.

    Weed-suppressive allelopathic cultivars can also be used to reduce weed infesta- 
tion without incurring any extra cost. This method of weed control neither harms the  
environment nor increase weed management costs. Allelopathic weed control may be  
applied as a single strategy in certain cropping systems (Farooq et al. 2011). Further,  
it can also be integrated with other methods to achieve effective control. Under allelo- 
pathic weed control strategies, the allelopathic potential of crops is manipulated in  
such a way that the allelochemicals from these crops reduce weed competition (Jabran  
et al. 2015). Many authors have studied the status of allelopathic cultivars of rice and  
the weeds suppressed by them in various parts of the world (Table  14.4). 

14.5.2.6       Crop Rotation and Cropping System 

Every crop allows specific weeds to grow in their association. These specific weeds  
are recognized in different rotations, and thus are controlled by rotating crops hav- 
ing  different  life  cycle  and  cultural  habits.  For  instance,  different  planting  and

harvest dates of rotating crops prevent weed establishment and seed production, and  
thus provide more opportunities for farmers to control weeds (Rao 2011). 
    There are three main mechanisms under which rotations cause the alteration of  
selection  pressures. These  are  (i)  altering  management  practices  (timing  of  field  
activities, herbicides, etc.), (ii) varying patterns of resource competition, and (iii)  
allelopathy. However, all the three mechanisms are not utilized by all the rotations.  
So, it should be considered while looking at the effects of a particular rotation on  
weed dynamics that which mechanism is being utilized by a particular crop rotation  
(Nichols et al. 2015). Development of cropping systems such as appropriate spatial  
arrangement and efficient tillage can be helpful for crops themselves to compete  
with weeds (Avola et al.  2008). However, good understanding of weed dynamics  
and influences of crop- and soil-related factors on weed life cycles is required if we  
want to use the cropping system manipulation as a component of integrated weed  
management (Davis and Liebman 2003).

    Intensification of rice-based cropping sequence caused reduction in weed density  
as  well  as  weed  dry  matter  production.  The  rice–wheat–green  gram  sequence  
recorded lowest population of all the three groups of weeds. So, crop rotation along  
with  other  control  methods  can  be  considered  as  an  effective  tool  of  Integrated  
Weed Management (IWM) that affects the soil seed bank and weed flora. 

14.5.3       Physical Control Methods  

Physical control of weeds can be done by manual or mechanical methods. Hand  
weeding is the most widely applied intervention against weeds across rice sys- 
tems. Although it is effective in reducing direct competition from weeds and in  
preventing  weeds  from  producing  and  shedding  seeds,  it  is  extremely  labor  
demanding,  requiring  250–780  work  h  ha−1  (Rodenburg  and  Johnson  2009).  
Roder (2001) found that 150–200 labor-day ha−1 are required for manual weed- 

ing to keep rice crop free of weeds. Besides this, hand weeding becomes diffi- 
cult at early stages of growth because of the morphological similarity between  
grassy  weeds  and  rice  seedlings.  Damage  to  the  rice  seedlings  by  weeding  
(Moody and Cordova  1985) and delay in weed control due to unavailability or  
high wages of labor (Johnson  1996) or due to poor weather conditions are other  
problems  with  manual  weeding.  Singh  et  al.  (2007)  also  found  that  manual  
weeding required 100–120 person-days ha−1 to keep fields of DSR weed-free for  

the whole season. In these situations, mechanical weeding using different tools  
such  as  hand  hoe/blade  hoe/wheel  hoe  is  helpful.  In  line- sown  crops,  rotary  
weeders or cono weeders are also effective in controlling weeds. Different types  
of  weeders  or  hoes  are  used  either  in  combination  with  other  methods  or  
independently. 
    Akbar et al. (2011) found that both hand pulling and mechanical hoeing were  
better  than  herbicides  in  suppression  of  weeds  and  increasing  yield.  Mechanical  
hoeing caused a 72 % reduction in total weed density and a 25 % increase in grain  
yield of rice compared to the control. Hasanuzzaman et al. (2007) found that weed  
density and weed dry matter were effectively reduced by the mechanical and man- 
ual weed control methods, and also with the combination of chemical and physical  
methods. Weed control efficiency was found highest with combinations of chemical  
and physical control methods. 
    No doubt, mechanical weed control has been proved very useful. But because of  
their limited scope to row-seeded crops only, this is not a very common method.  
Besides this, an optimum soil–water condition is required for mechanical weeders  
to work efficiently and effectively. However, combinations of mechanical weeding  
with preemergence herbicide applications can be used as an effective tool in inte- 
grated weed management in DSR (Matloob et al. 2015). Moreover, in some situa- 
tions, where chemical or other methods fail to control weeds (i.e., continuous rains  
or dry spells), mechanical weeding could be more effective. Mechanical weeders  
can also help to reduce overall herbicide use.

14.5.4       Chemical Control 

The traditional methods of weed control practices include preparatory land tillage,  
hand weeding by hoe, and hand pulling. Depending on the nature of the weeds, their  
intensity of infestation and the crop grown, usually two or three hand weedings are  
normally  done  for  effective  control.  But,  weed  control  in  transplanted  rice  by  
mechanical and cultural means is expensive, especially at periods of labor crisis.  
Besides the high labor costs as well as labor scarcity, unfavorable weather condi- 
tions and morphological similarity of some weeds (E. colona and E. crus-galli) to  
rice have made chemical methods more popular than traditional methods. 
   In the recent years, rice growers in many Asian countries are shifting from trans- 
planting to dry seeding systems. Weeds have become the major constraint for farm- 
ers  practicing  direct  seeding  (Rao  et  al.  2007).  In  the  traditional  transplanting  
method, weeds are suppressed by standing water, but in DSR systems, the inherent  
weed control from standing water at rice establishment is lost and weeds emerge  
concurrently with rice thereby competing with rice for resources. In DSR systems  
also, various cultural, mechanical, manual, and chemical weed management strate- 
gies can be practiced to control weeds. However, among the different weed control  
strategies, chemical weed control is considered the most efficient and economical  
(Suria et al. 2011; Khaliq et al. 2012). The use of herbicides reduces the weed con- 
trol time by 100 h ha−1 compared with hand weeding in DSR. Therefore, most rice  

farmers who practice DSR adopt herbicides (Mazid et al. 2003). 
   Among herbicides, sulfonylurea and phenoxy compounds are the widely used  
chemicals  for  controlling  sedges  and  broadleaved  weeds  in  DSR  (Mahajan  and  
Chauhan  2013b). Rao et al. (2007) reported an extensive use of propanil, pendi- 
methalin, fenoxaprop, molinate, thiobencarb, quinclorac, butachlor, and acetochlor  
for  controlling  grass  weeds.  For  controlling  annual  grasses,  annual  sedges,  and  
broad leaved weeds, oxadiazon herbicide has been found to be effective (Dickmann  
et al.  1997). Similarly, the application of bispyribac-sodium as postemergence has  
been found to be very effective against grasses and broadleaved weeds (Jabran et al.  
2012a; Khaliq et al. 2012). Pre-emergence herbicides (oxadiazon, pendimethalin,  
etc.) are applied within three DAS of rice, preferably immediately after planting and  
before the emergence of weeds and crops (Jabran et al. 2012a,b). Early postemer- 
gence herbicides (butachlor, propanil, thiobencarb, etc.) are applied at the two to  
four leaf stages. Late postemergence herbicides (e.g., bispyribac-sodium, azimsul- 
furon,  fenoxaprop,  ethoxysulfuron,  2,4-D)  are  usually  applied  on  leaves  and  the  
application time ranges from 14 to 28 DAS (Awan et al. 2015). Singh et al. (2007)  
reported that pre-emergence application of pretilachlor + safener at 500 g ha−1 or  
pendimethalin at 1.0 kg ha−1 followed by one hand weeding effectively controlled  

weeds  and  proved  effective  in  increasing  yields  of  DSR,  resulting  in  higher  net  
income. 
   When the crop is infested with complex and diverse weed species, a single her- 
bicide cannot control all weed species. In such situations, effective weed control can  
be  achieved  by  a  combination  of  herbicides  (sequential  applications  or  tank

 mixtures) or a broad-spectrum herbicide along with other cultural practices. This  
practice can ensure effective control of all groups of weeds such as sedges, broad- 
leaves, and grasses (Awan et al. 2015). Singh et al. (2006) found that both grass and  
broadleaf weeds were effectively controlled when tank mixture of fenoxaprop-ethyl  
plus  ethoxysulfuronat  50  +  18  g  ha−1  was  applied  as  postemergence  at  18–21  

DAS. When different herbicides are used in combination, care should be taken that  
different herbicides should be compatible with one another and they should not have  
antagonistic effect. Zhang et al. (2005) also found that there is an antagonistic effect  
of fenoxaprop activity on Echinochloa spp. when applied in combination with ben- 
sulfuron, carfentrazone, halosulfuron, and triclopyr. Similarly, a tank-mix applica- 
tion of fenoxaprop-ethyl or cyhalofop-butyl with chlorimuron plus metsulfuron or  
2,4-D also showed an antagonistic effect. Awan et al. (2015) found that oxadiazon  
as the best broad-spectrum herbicide when applied alone or in combinations with  
other postemergence herbicides in effectively controlling all dominant weed species  
present at the site (Table  14.5). 
    Herbicides have been proved very important weed management tool in rice cul- 
tivation.  However,  for  effective  and  safe  herbicide  use,  the  appropriate  product,  
application   equipment,   and   application   rates   are   important   (Zimdahl  2007).  
Moreover, herbicide application requires good timing with respect to crop and the  
growth stage of weeds (King and Oliver  1992), weather conditions (Hammerton  
1967), and flooding. For example, foliar active herbicides such as bentazon, 2,4-D,  
and triclopyr should be applied after draining of water for better contact of the her- 
bicide with leaves (Singh et al. 2009). However, some herbicides such as molinate  
need to be applied in water as an application on drained fields would result in its loss  
by volatility. Sulfonylureas should be applied in water, as flood water acts as a car- 
rier for their even distribution. Different herbicides that have been reported to be  
effective against different types of weeds in DSR are listed in Table  14.6 (Singh  
et al. 2009). 

14.5.5       Biological Control  

Biological weed control is the technique in which natural enemies (biological con- 
trol agents) of weeds are employed to control weeds in crop without significantly  
affecting  the  desirable  plants.  These  biological  agents  include  insects,  animals,  
fishes  (e.g.,  Chinese  carp),  snails,  birds  (e.g.,  duck),  microbes  (fungi,  bacteria,  
viruses, nematodes, etc.), their toxic products, and plants (parasite plants and com- 
peting plants) or their products. This approach can be proved even more helpful  
when there is a need to develop new weed management strategies because of the  
development of some herbicide-resistant weeds. 
    Biological control can be classified into two approaches, viz. the classical and  
the bioherbicide approaches (Hallett 2005). The classical approach that involves  
the  use  of  exotic  predators  or  pathogens  has  not  been  implemented  in  rice.  
However, there has been great research interest in the development of bioherbi-

    Fungal pathogens can be exploited as biological agents for the management of  
weeds  (Motlagh  2011).  The  fungus  Trichoderma  viride  Pers.  and  Gliocladium  
virens have been found to control Echinochloa spp. in rice under laboratory condi- 
tions  without  any  adverse  effect  on  the  crop  (ICAR  2007).  Similarly,  fungus  
Fusarium equiseti has been found to infect Echinochloa crus-galli in a higher rate  
compared to rice cultivar (Motlagh 2011). Hence, Fusarium equiseti can be consid- 
ered as a probable bioherbicide for controlling of E. crus-galli at the two to three  
leaf stage of growth of weed. Charudattan ( 1991) and Smith (1991) reported that an  
endemic  fungal  pathogen,  Colletotrichum  gloeosporioides  (Penz.)  Sacc  f.  sp.

14    Rice Weeds and Their Management                                                                  381 

aeschynomene  (C.g.a.),  has  been  registered  in  the  United  States  for  control  of  
Aeschynomene virginica (L.) B.S.P. in rice (COLLEGO3,4). Puccinia canaliculata  
(Biosedget) was reported to control C. esculentus and inhibited new tuber formation  
by 66 % (Boyetchko  1997). Similarly, Rhynchosporium alismatis (Oudem.) J. J.  
Davis has been reported to control Damasonium minus (R. Br.) Buch, an important  
native plant species considered to be the most important weed in rice growing areas  
of Australia (Jahromi et al. 2004). Biological strategies of weed control in rice also  
include  wild  ducks  (Smith  and  Sullivan  1980)  and  insects  (Oraze  and  Grigarick  
 1992). Farmers in Arkansas, USA, attract the ducks by flooding the rice fields dur- 
ing the winter, which control the weedy rice (Oryza sativa f. spontanea) by feeding  
on their seeds. From the 9 consecutive years’ field experiments in China, it was  
reported that under rice–duck farming, the number of weed species in the weed seed  
bank declined from 38 to 21 and the density of both the weed seed bank and the  
above-ground weed decreased by more than 90 % (Li et al. 2012). Rice–duck farm- 
ing  resulted  in  a  more  uniform  vertical  distribution  of  the  weed  seed  bank  both  
quantitatively and qualitatively. Thus, subsequent rice crops are benefited with this  
strategy. Similarly, aphids are used as controlling agents of some aquatic weeds of  
rice in California. 
    The biological control methods can be proved a very helpful tool in weed man- 
agement  of  rice.  However,  integration  of  biological  methods  with  other  control  
methods  is  essential  in  weed  management  programs  in  rice  production  systems  
(Smith  1991). It is because of the narrow range of the biological control methods.  
Biological  strategies  control  a  comparatively  narrow  spectrum  of  weed  species  
compared to chemical or other methods. For example, to control the complex of  
weed species in the rice field, sole biological method cannot be relied upon. 

14.5.6        Integrated Weed Management  

As discussed earlier, weeds are a major constraint in rice cultivation, especially in  
DSR and the success of rice cultivation can be ensured by the proper control of  
weeds. Until 1940s, physical, cultural, and biological means were the main weed  
management tools (Juraimi et al. 2013). Since the introduction of herbicides in late  
 1940s, it has been believed that herbicides can solve the weed problem for long  
run. But, after over 50 years of extensive use of herbicides, now it is evident that  
sole  reliance  on  herbicides  is  not  a  long  lasting  strategy  (Juraimi  et  al.  2013).  
Intensive use of herbicides can cause environmental contamination, the evolution  
of herbicide resistance in weeds (Heap 2016), and the impoverishment of the natu- 
ral flora and fauna. Over reliance on herbicides also can cause the shift in weed  
species dominance (Azmi and Baki 2002). Besides this, presence of intensive and  
complex weed flora implies that relying on a single practice would not only result  
in failed weed control, but can also lead to resistance evolution in weeds and devel- 
opment of problematic weed flora (Jabran and Chauhan 2015). Because of all these

problems, there is a need to find ways on how to reduce the unwarranted environ- 
mental hazards posed by the use of herbicides and how to eliminate labor-intensive  
manual weeding in rice. So, there is a need to reevaluate the physical, cultural, and  
biological weed management strategies as integrated with chemical weed control  
methods judiciously. This system of combining different weed management meth- 
ods is known as integrated weed management. It involves the selection, integration,  
and  implementation  of  effective  weed  control  means  with  due  consideration  of  
economics,  environmental,  and  sociological  consequences. The  integrated  weed  
management  better  utilizes  resources  and  offers  a  wider  range  of  management  
options (Buhler et al. 2000). 
   Integration of improved agronomic practices, timeliness of operations, optimum  
fertilization and water management, and incorporation of crop residues in the soil  
can be helpful to increase the efficiency of applied herbicides and to improve the  
crop competitiveness against weeds (Chauhan et al. 2012). Subramanian and Martin  
(2006)  reported  that  effective  weed  control  was  achieved  by  pretilachlor  with  
safener at 400 g ha−1 combined with sesbania intercropping and azolla dual crop- 

ping.  Pretilachlor  with  safener  +  daincha  intercropping  +  azolla  dual  cropping  
maintained its superiority by registering higher grain yield (57.4 q ha−1), which was  

60 and 10 % higher than the weedy check and recommended practice of two hand  
weedings,  respectively.  As  compared  to  the  sole  application  of  butachlor,  pre-  
emergence  application  of  butachlor  +  intercrop  with  sesbania  incorporation  and  
mechanical weeding at 35 days after transplanting recorded lower weed density at  
all  the  stages  of  crop  growth,  lower  weed  seed  count,  and  higher  crop  yield  
(Govindan and Chinnusamy 2014). Among different weed control treatments, inte- 
grated weed management including criss-cross sowing plus one hand weeding plus  
herbicide provided better results than those obtained from only one weed control  
method,  that  is,  two  hand  weedings  and  no  weeding  (Sharma  and  Singh  2008).  
Many  researchers  have  advocated  adoption  of  integrated  weed  management  
approach for sustainable rice production (Bhurer et al. 2013; Azmi and Baki 2002;  
Sunil et al. 2010; Jayadeva et al. 2011). Some possible integrated weed management  
practices in aerobic rice have been elaborated in Table  14.8. Therefore, integrated  
weed management is the most feasible and practical option to achieve sustainable  
weed control in rice systems. It provides not only economical weed control but also  
helps to tackle problems like herbicide resistance, environment degradation, etc. 
   Some of the outstanding examples of integrated weed management in DSR that  
proved effective in South Asia, for example, increasing N application rate up to  
150 kg ha−1 caused significant improvement in grain yield when the weeds were  

well controlled either by pendimethalin followed by (fb) bispyribac-sodium or by  
pendimethalin fb bispyribac– sodium fb 1 hand weeding (HW), respectively; how- 
ever, under poor weed control condition (pendimethalin fb 1 HW), it resulted in a  
drastic reduction in yield (Mahajan and Timsina 2011). Higher seed rates in DSR  
caused  significant  reductions  in  weed  dry  matter,  whereas  higher  than  optimum  
seed rate (15–30 kg ha−1) caused reduction in yield (Mahajan et al. 2010). Genotype  

for instance Punjab Mehak 1 produced similar grain yields in paired and uniform  
planting patterns (Mahajan and Chauhan 2011); whereas PR 115 had higher grain

14.5.7        Herbicide-Tolerant Rice  

Several selective herbicides have been introduced that affect the weeds adversely,  
yet  do  not  harm  rice.  But,  herbicide-resistant  weeds  and  weedy  or  wild  rice  are  
becoming more challenging problems for the rice farmers in the world. In both the  
cases  (i.e.  herbicide-resistant  weeds  and  weedy  or  wild  rice),  the  adoption  of  
herbicide- tolerant rice can prove a very useful tool for weed control. When a rice  
plant is tolerant to a particular herbicide or herbicides that can otherwise damage the  
plant, this rice is referred to as herbicide-tolerant rice (IRRI  2015). In rice, three  
herbicide-tolerant rice systems have been developed. These are imidazolinone-, glu-

glyphosate-tolerant   rice   cultivars,   transgenic   technologies   were   used.  While,  
imidazolinone- tolerant rice was developed by chemically induced seed mutagenesis  
and  conventional  breeding.  Herbicide-tolerant  rice  cultivars  provide  a  classical,  
safe, and yet novel and effective way of weed management through the application  
of  new  generation’s  highly  effective,  nontoxic,  and  rapidly  biodegradable  herbi- 
cides (Mahajan and Chauhan 2013a). Kumar et al. (2008) and Chauhan et al. (2014)  
also  suggested  that  adoption  of  herbicide-tolerant  rice  can  solve  the  problem  of  
weeds, especially herbicide-resistant weeds and weedy rice in DSR. 
                                                   ® 
   First, herbicide-tolerant rice (Clearfield   rice) was developed in the USA to  
deal with weedy rice commonly known as red rice in the USA. Up to 2012, it was  
the only herbicide-tolerant rice available for farmers in some countries to grow.  
The  herbicide-tolerant  Clearfield  rice  technology  provides  an  option  to  control  
weedy rice in rice using imidazolinone herbicides, particularly the imazethapyr  
(Croughan 2003). Besides the Clearfield rice, some other herbicide-tolerant rice  
including  Liberty  Link®  and  Roundup  Ready®  rice  also  have  been  developed  
(IRRI 2015). 
   No doubt, herbicide-tolerant rice can help to improve weed control, including  
weedy and wild rices, and to reduce weed control costs and the labor associated  
with  manual  removal  of  weeds.  However,  if  this  weed  management  tool,  i.e.,  
herbicide- tolerant rice is not managed properly, weed problems are very likely to  
become more serious, especially in rice monoculture systems. By mismanagement  
of herbicide-tolerant rice, herbicide resistance can spread to weedy and wild rice via  
cross-pollination and their control can become more difficult. Besides this, resis- 
tance to similar herbicides in a range of weeds can be developed by the increased  
use of one herbicide type. Thus, the effectiveness of current herbicides could be  
reduced. Herbicide-tolerant rice can become a problem when the seeds of herbicide-  
tolerant  rice  in  the  soil  turn  into  weeds  in  subsequent  years  when  different  rice  
varieties are grown. There is a long list of rice weeds globally, which have devel- 
oped resistance to herbicides (Heap 2016). 

14.6      Conclusions 

Weeds are the key biological constraints that obstruct the growth and productivity  
of rice systems. Weed flora is being changed quickly in response to changing agro- 
nomic management. Therefore, appropriate weed management strategies and tech- 
nologies are needed to maintain yield stability and reduce the cost of production.  
There are several weed management strategies for rice systems in combination with  
agronomic  tools  like  seed  rate,  row  spacing,  planting  pattern,  planting  density,  
exploiting weed competitive cultivars. The use of any single strategy cannot provide  
effective, season-long, and sustainable weed control as different weeds have differ- 
ent  growth  habits.  The  complex  and  diverse  weed  flora  along  with  the  risk  of  
herbicide- resistance evolution emphasize the need for integrated weed management  
strategies,  especially  in  aerobic  rice  systems.  The  integrated  implementation  of

weed control practices not only effectively control weeds in rice systems but also  
improve the quality of the produce.

Ecology and Management of Apple Snails  
in Rice 

Finbarr G. Horgan 

15.1       Summary 

Apple snails (Ampulariidae) occur throughout tropical and subtropical rice- growing  
regions. Native apple snails rarely damage rice; however, in hot and humid tropical  
regions, some native species will damage wet-direct-seeded rice (i.e., Pomacea spp.  
in Suriname and Brazil). Similarly, exotic apple snails in wet, temperate regions can  
damage direct-seeded rice (i.e., Pomacea canaliculata in Japan). However, if left  
unmanaged, exotic apple snails in warm tropical regions (i.e., P. canaliculata and  
P. maculata in South East Asia) can cause significant economic losses even to trans- 
planted rice (which is more robust that direct-seeded rice). The negative impact of  
apple snails on rice yield can be reduced by reducing seedling vulnerability or con- 
trolling  snail  population  densities.  Reducing  vulnerability  is  a  more  sustainable  
solution to apple snails but requires new methods such as seedling broadcasting and  
machine  transplanting  to  decrease  labor  costs.  To  avoid  further  spread  of  apple  
snails, the implementation of effective quarantine directives is recommended for  
tropical countries that are vulnerable to exotic apple snails. 

15.2       Introduction 

Apple snails (Ampullariidae) are regarded among the most destructive invasive spe- 
cies  globally.  Several  species  of  apple  snail—originally  from  eastern  South  
America—have  been  introduced  and  established  in  the  Pacific  regions  of  South  
America (west of the Andes), in North America, in South East Asia, and in southern

Europe  (Horgan  et  al.  2014a)  (Fig.  15.1).  Many  of  these  regions  are  major  rice  
(Oryza sativa L.) producing areas and some (particularly in Asia) are important rice  
“bowls” for developing nations. Apple snails were introduced into South East Asia  
between  the  1980s  and  2000s  with  devastating  consequences  for  the  rice  sector.  
However, it is worrisome, that despite the damage caused by these introductions,  
apple  snails  continue  to  be  deliberately  introduced  to  rice-growing  regions,  e.g.,  
Pomacea canaliculata (Lamarck) was introduced to Ecuador about 2005 (Horgan  
et al. 2014b); Pomacea maculata Perry (synonym of Pomacea insularus) was intro- 
duced to the Ebro region of Spain about 2009 (European Food Safety Authority  
2012); P. canaliculata was introduced to Haleji Lake, near a major rice-growing  
region of Pakistan about 2012 (Baloch et al. 2012); and Pomacea spp. were intro- 
duced to the Ayeyarwady region of Myanmar about 2012 (communications with the  
Plant Protection Division of the Myanmar Government) (Fig.  15.2). 
    Apple snails will damage most aquatic crops including taro (Colocasia esculenta  
[L.] Schott), water chestnut (Trapa bicornis Osbeck), and water cress (Rorippa sco- 
poli spp.) as well as functionally important plants such as Azolla (Azolla spp.) and  
lotus (Nelumbo nucifera Gaertner) (Cowie 2002). However, the damage to rice by  
apple snails has attracted considerable research attention because of the extent of  
rice-growing  activities  globally  and  the  importance  of  rice  in  human  nutrition  
(Cowie 2002; Global Rice Science Partnership 2013). Apple snails damage rice by  
rasping the tender rice stems of newly sown and young transplanted rice plants, and  
by consuming leaves during crop establishment; this often kills the developing seed- 
lings and results in patches of “missing hills” or bare-ground where the plants have  
failed to develop (Litsinger and Estano  1993). Few studies have estimated the eco- 
nomic impact of rice damage from apple snails or the costs (monitory or ecological)

of  the  massive  increases  in  molluscicide  use  that  follow  invasion  (Wada  2004;  
Adalla and Magsino 2006; Horgan et al. 2014b). However, there is ample evidence  
to suggest that invasive apple snails severely impact wetland ecosystems in general  
(Horgan et al. 2014a) and are currently a nuisance to producers over much of the  
world’s rice-growing regions (Joshi and Sebastian 2006). This chapter examines the  
nature and management of the apple snail species that damage rice crops, focusing  
on how snail biology and ecology determine their pest status and ultimately dictate  
optimal, regionally specific strategies for their management. 

15.3       Species and Records of Damage to Rice 

Apple snails are freshwater snails that naturally occur throughout the humid tropics  
and subtropics. The genus Pomacea and Marisa are mainly of South and Central  
American origin. The genus Pila occurs naturally throughout South and South East  
Asia, and in some parts of Africa (Cowie 2002; Hayes et al. 2008) (Fig. 15.1). There  
are over 100 species of apple snail; however, research attention has focused on about  
14 species (mainly Pomacea spp.) that have invaded new regions since the 1960s  
mainly through the pet trade (Horgan et al.  2014a). The most rapid and extensive

expansion in apple snail distribution occurred during the 1980s and 1990s when  
several species (P. canaliculata, Pomacea diffusa Blume, P. maculata, and Pomacea  
scalaris  d’Orbigny)  became  established  in  South  East Asia  (Hayes  et  al.  2008;  
Horgan et al. 2014a). Over their native ranges, most apple snails (i.e., Pila conica  
Wood in the Philippines and Pila polita [Deshayes] in Thailand) do not significantly  
affect rice production and are often beneficial sources of supplementary foods or  
medicine (Bombeo-Tubaran et al.  1995; Thaewnon-ngiw et al. 2003). In Asia, the  
native species Pila polita (Deshayes), Pila pilosa (possibly a misidentification), and  
Pila globosa (Swainson) have been associated with only minor levels of damage to  
rice (Cowie 2002). Most records of damage from native apple snails (Lanistes spp.)  
in Africa are now over 40 years old, without any further reports of damage or any  
recent research attention. Lanistes carinatus Olivier and Lanistes ovum Peters were  
reported to damage rice in the Nile region and in Sierra Leone (Cowie 2002) and a  
report from Swaziland in the 1960s indicated that L. ovum caused severe damage to  
rice in an irrigation project (Crossland  1965) possibly due to poor drainage at the  
site  (Tyler  2008).  Under  certain  crop  establishment  systems,  particularly  direct  
seeding (see below), even native apple snails might pose a risk to rice production. 
   In the Americas, Marisa cornuarietis (L.) (a species introduced for biological  
control  purposes)  occasionally  causes  damage  to  young  rice  seedlings  in  the  
Caribbean   (Ortíz-Torres   1962;   Donnay   and   Beissinger   1993;   Cowie  2002).  
Similarly, Pomacea glauca (L.) and Pomacea lineata (Spix) have been associated  
with damage to rice in Suriname and Venezuela (Wiryareja and Tjoe-Awie 2006).  
However, it is likely that some records of these latter two species represent misiden- 
tifications  of  Pomacea  dolioides  (Reeve)  (Hayes  et  al.  2012).  In  recent  years,   
P. canaliculata in its native range in southern Brazil and P. dolioides in its native  
range in Suriname and northern Brazil have become serious pests of  wet-direct-seeded  
rice (also known as pregerminated rice). Whereas damage due to  P. canaliculata  
and P. maculata has been limited to wet-direct-seeded rice in the Americas, these  
two species have been associated with severe damage to transplanted rice in South  
East Asia  (Joshi  and  Sebastian  2006).  It  is  noteworthy  that  P.  canaliculata  and   
P. maculata in South East Asia were recorded together as a single species (P. cana- 
liculata) during the 1980s and 1990s. Therefore, the impact that each of these spe- 
cies (and particularly P. maculata) has had on rice production in Asia is still largely  
unknown. The impact of P. maculata on rice in North America seems to be low:  
Cold winter temperatures in temperate regions may limit snail activity, recruitment,  
and consequent damage to rice (Burlakova et al. 2010). 

15.4      Broad Effects of Climate and Rice Production Systems  
         on Snail Damage Potential 

Because of the wide geographical distribution of both rice production landscapes  
and apple snails (native and invasive), the relative impact of apple snails on different  
rice ecosystems varies considerably. Understanding the underlying ecology of such  
variations  can  be  useful  to  assess  crop  vulnerability  and  to  choose  medium-  to

long- term strategies for snail management. Figure  15.1 indicates five main catego- 
ries of interaction scenario under which apple snails encounter rice crops. These can  
be explained as follows: 

Category 1: Regions where management of native apple snails is not required in  
   transplanted and dry seeded crops (i.e., P. canaliculata in Argentina (Cazzaniga  
   2006))  but  where  potential  for  damage  is  high  (up  to  100  %  losses)  in  
    wet-direct- seeded crops (i.e., P. dolioides in Suriname (Wiryareja and Tjoe-Awie  
   2006);  P.  canaliculata  in  Southern  Brazil  (Sociedade  Sul-Brasileira  de Arroz  
   Irrigado 2010); and L. ovum in Swaziland (Crossland  1965)). Rice pasture rota- 
   tions, late flooding, and efficient regulation by natural enemies reduce the dam- 
   age potential of apple snails in most native regions (Cazzaniga 2006). 
Category 2: Regions invaded by apple snails that are close to their original distribu- 
   tion range and where natural enemies (e.g., predatory birds and diseases) can  
   expand  their  distribution  range  with  the  snails  (i.e.,  M.  cornuarietis  in  the  
   Caribbean (Cowie  2002); P. canaliculata in the Dominican Republic (Rosario  
   and Moquete 2006) and in Ecuador (Horgan et al. 2014b); P. globosa in south  
   India (Thomas  1975); Pomacea lattrei (Reeve) in Panama (Angehr  1999)). In  
   such regions, regulation by natural enemies may be expected to reduce damage  
   after a short time during which natural enemies adapt and accumulate. However,  
   the impact of the snails on rice production in these regions is often similar to  
   category 3 (below). 
Category 3: Tropical regions invaded by apple snails that have adequate climatic  
   conditions for maximum snail survival and fitness and few natural enemies (Fig.  
    15.2). For example, throughout tropical and subtropical Asia, P. canaliculata and  
   P. maculata cause severe damage to rice under all types of establishment meth- 
   ods  and  are  a  major  concern  for  rice  farmers  (Halwart  1994;  Naylor  1996).  
   Heavy damage (50–100 % of seedlings destroyed) has been reported in Taiwan  
   (Yang  et  al.  2006),  the  Philippines  (Litsinger  and  Estano  1993;  Sanico  et  al.  
   2002), and South China (Wu and Xie 2006); however, there is still a paucity of  
   data on damage levels from most regions where the snails have established. A  
   high cropping intensity (≥2 crops per year) and continuous flooding throughout  
   the year contribute to the high snail densities, a high potential for damage to rice,  
   and  enormous  labor  and  management  costs  following  invasion  (Litsinger  and  
   Estano  1993; Halwart 1994; Naylor 1996; Adalla and Magsino 2006). 
Category 4: Wet temperate regions where apple snails may cause relatively little  
   damage to transplanted rice, but high damage (>30 % of seedlings destroyed) to  
   direct-seeded rice (Wada 2004). Several detailed studies have been conducted in  
   Japan  where  the  distribution  range  of  P.  canaliculata  approaches  its  northern  
   limits. Rice in Japan is predominantly transplanted, either mechanically or man- 
   ually, and crop rotation (mainly with soybean, Glycine max [L.] Merr.) is increas- 
   ingly practiced due to government efforts to reduce rice overproduction (Wada  
   2004). Winter mortality is a major constraint for the snails and populations must  
   build up from low numbers of overwintering adults at the beginning of the crop- 
   ping season (Syobu et al.  2001). However, the recovery is often rapid during  
   warm spring and summer months (Wada 2004).

Category 5: Dry temperate and Mediterranean regions recently invaded by apple  
   snails where snail dispersal is likely to be slow due to dry conditions, but where  
   recruitment and population growth are fast due to mild winter temperatures (i.e.,  
   Texas  (Burlakova  et  al.  2010);  California  (United  States  Geological  Survey  
   2012); Cataluña, Spain (European Food Safety Authority 2012); Chile (Jackson  
   and Jackson  2009)). Damage to rice is often low (<5 %); however, some rice  
   ecosystems in these regions are high value amenity areas that are vulnerable to  
   perturbations; once apple snails have established in these habitats, they become  
   difficult to manage because of continuously favorable conditions for snail sur- 
   vival. Such vulnerable habitats include the winter flooded rice fields of California,  
   USA (Elphick and Oring  1998) and the Ebro Delta of Cataluña (European Food  
   Safety Authority 2012). 

   Management practices against apple snails in rice can be selected based on the  
biology of the snails and the effects of local climatic and geographical conditions  
on their population dynamics, particularly their reproduction and time to sexual  
maturity.  Management  approaches  can  be  divided  into  two  groups.  The  first  
includes a suite of cultural control methods aimed at reducing snail damage to the  
rice crop, but without attempting to reduce snail population densities. These meth- 
ods reduce rice crop vulnerability by restricting snail movements or avoiding vul- 
nerable  seedling  stages.  The  second  group  of  management  approaches  aims  at  
reducing snail population densities through poisoning, mechanically crushing the  
snails, or using biological control and manual collections. The later methods are  
often nonselective and also affect beneficial aquatic organisms; they exert selection  
pressures on the snails toward avoidance and adaptation to management; and they  
are often short-term solutions, because apple snails, particularly without natural  
enemies, can rapidly build up numbers. The best approaches to management will  
often combine several management techniques (Litsinger and Estano  1993; Yanes  
Figueroa et al. 2014). These management approaches are discussed in the sections  
that follow. 

15.5      Reducing Rice Crop Vulnerability to Apple Snails  
         (Crop Establishment Methods) 

In rice paddies, apple snails feed on a range of macrophytes including both the rice  
plants and their associated weeds (Litsinger and Estano  1993; Sanico et al. 2002;  
Joshi and Sebastian 2006). The higher nutrient levels of crop plants result in marked  
feeding preferences by apple snails for some crops over macrophyte weeds (Qiu and  
Kwong 2009); however, leaf and stem dry matter content ultimately determine mac- 
rophyte palatability and hence the vulnerability of plants to snail damage (Wong et al.  
2010; Yanes Figueroa et al. 2014). Dry matter content increases with an increase in  
plants age: Seedling stages of both rice and weeds are most vulnerable to snail attack  
but resistance to snails increases as plants grow older (Yanes Figueroa et al. 2014).

There is also a direct relationship between snail size and the maximum age of seed- 
lings that may be consumed: Large snails can feed on rice seedlings across a greater  
age  range,  whereas  small  snails  can  feed  only  on  young  seedlings  (Litsinger  and  
Estano  1993; Teo 2003; Wada 2004; Yanes Figueroa et al. 2014). Furthermore, feed- 
ing by snails is limited to water that is deep enough to allow snail movement—this is  
often considered as roughly equal to the height of the snail shell (Litsinger and Estano  
1993; Teo 2003). Since smaller snails are less damaging, a depth of 3–5 cm is consid- 
ered by many researchers as sufficient to limit the movement of larger snails and  
inhibit feeding damage (Litsinger and Estano  1993; Teo 2003; Wada 2004). Water  
depths of below 1 cm can eliminate damage entirely (Teo 2003). Therefore, the choice  
of rice crop establishment method is a key determinant of vulnerability to apple snails  
because crop establishment is largely defined by rice age at transplanting or broad- 
casting and by water depth. Rice crop establishment methods can be grouped into six  
main categories (see below). These methods are adopted by farmers based on labor  
costs, irrigation costs, and issues of weed management (De Datta  1981). Farmers  
rarely consider risks from apple snails when choosing a crop establishment method  
(Horgan et al. 2014b) despite the impacts of apple snails at this vulnerable crop stage.  
Table  15.1 indicates methods to reduce rice vulnerability to apple snails.  

15.5.1       Transplanting 

Seedling transplanting consists of sowing rice to wet or dry seed beds and, when the  
seedlings reach a certain age (usually >20 days), the rice is transplanted by hand or  
machine to puddled rice paddies. Snail damage to transplanted rice varies consider- 
ably depending on snail density, seedling age, the number of seedlings per hill, and  
water depth. Where snail densities are high (>5 snails m−2), damage to 15-day-old  

seedlings can reach 100 % (Sanico et al. 2002), and damage to 20-day-old seedlings  
is between 80 % and 90 % (Litsinger and Estano 1993; Sanico et al. 2002; Teo 2003). 

15.5.1.1     Delayed Transplanting 

Damage can be avoided by planting older seedlings, for example, delaying trans- 
planting by 7–10 days (28- to 30-day-old seedlings) can reduce seedling mortality  
by  30–60  %  and  delaying  by  14–20  days  (35-  to  40-day-old  seedlings)  reduces  
seedling mortality by 50–75 % (Litsinger and Estano 1993; Sanico et al. 2002; Teo  
2003; Yanes Figueroa et al. 2014). Some rice varieties experience yield- reducing  
transplanting shock if seedlings are too old at the time of transplanting; this limits  
the age of transplanting to below 40 days for most varieties. The intensity of trans- 
planting shock may be more severe for younger seedlings; however, older seedlings  
are thought to recover more slowly from shock (De Datta  1981). For example, Teo  
(2003) estimated that transplanting of seedlings at 40 days after sowing resulted in  
significant yield declines (19–22 % reduction) in the variety TR7 despite reducing  

----------------------- Page 407-----------------------

15   Ecology and Management of Apple Snails in Rice                                        405 

snail damage to zero. However, Sanico et al. (Sanico et al. 2002) found no effect of  
transplanting age (up to 35 days) on yield in IR72 under snail-free conditions, but,  
where snails were present, transplanting older seedlings increased yields by up to  
60 % compared to transplanting young seedlings (21 days old). 
   Despite the improvements gained from transplanting older seedlings, under high  
snail densities, yield reductions in the wet season can be as high as 20 % when seed- 
lings  are  transplanted  even  as  late  as  35  days—with  over  40  %  of  hills  missing  
(Sanico et al. 2002). Clearly the transplanting of older seedlings will not eliminate  
significant yield losses due to snails. Planting of more resistant or tolerant varieties  
could potentially reduce damage, but there is little concrete evidence to indicate vari- 
etal differences in seedling resistance or tolerance to snails. Therefore, delayed trans- 
planting must normally be combined with some other damage reduction method. 

15.5.1.2     Increasing Seeding Rates and the Number of Seedlings per Hill 

Increasing the number of seedlings per hill has been shown to reduce damage (miss- 
ing hills) and yield losses: For example, in an experiment by Yanes Figueroa et al.  
(2014)  increasing  seedlings  from  one  to  three  per  hill  increased  hill  survival  of  
18-day-old seedlings by up to 25 %. Sanico et al. (2002) found that increasing plant- 
ing from one to two seedlings per hill reduced damage to 35-day-old seedlings by  
about 75 % and increased yields by 16 %. Nevertheless, this still represented a loss  
in yield of nearly 15 % compared to optimal snail-free conditions (Sanico et al.  
2002). Improved seedbed management can further reduce losses to apple snails. For  
example,  Yanes   Figueroa   et   al.   (2014)   suggested   that   low-density   seeding  
(≤100 g m−2) on raised seedbeds can reduce damage by up to 25 % because the  

developing seedlings, under conditions of low intraspecific competition will have  
thicker stems that are difficult for the snails to feed on. By delaying transplanting,  
planting more than one seedling per hill, and using low sowing densities, damage in  
snail-infested ponds was reduced to <10 % (Yanes Figueroa et al. 2014). 

15.5.1.3     Field Draining 

In order to reduce snail damage further, transplanting of older seedlings is generally  
combined  with  some  period  of  short-term  field  draining.  Draining  paddy  fields  
reduces water levels to below 1–2 cm (although 0 cm is optimal for reducing snail  
damage, particularly in direct-seeded rice) (Teo 2003). Even under high snail densi- 
ties (5–6 snails m−2), draining fields for up to 10 days after transplanting can reduce  

damage to 21-day-old seedlings by 44 % (Teo 2003) to 69 % (Litsinger and Estano  
1993). For the best results, the soil should be level to reduce puddles where seed- 
lings can  be damaged. There are two important constraints to drainage for snail  
management—first,  rice  seedlings  may  become  stressed  under  dry  conditions:  
Despite reports of drainage for up to 3 weeks reducing snail damage to direct-seeded  
rice by over 99 % (Japan: Wada  2004), draining for as little as 10 days can cause

seedling stress and plant mortality (tropical South East Asia: Litsinger and Estano  
1993;  Teo  2003);  second,  during  periods  where  the  field  is  drained  of  standing  
water, weeds will germinate and compete with the delicate rice seedlings. 

15.5.2        Machine Transplanting  

Several mechanical (automated or semiautomated) transplanters are available for  
rice farmers. Machine transplanting reduces the labor costs of crop establishment  
and  are  particularly  popular  among  rice  farmers  in  Korea  and  Japan;  however,  
mechanical transplanters are often limited in developing countries because of high  
costs associated with purchasing the machinery (Horgan et al. 2014c). Rice seed- 
lings are specially prepared for machine transplanting by sowing in mat-bed trays.  
The seedlings are usually sown at high density without soil, making them akin to  
dapog seedlings (see below). The seedlings are usually transplanted as small clumps  
at <15 days old (Ghafoor et al. 2008; Horgan et al. 2014c). The restrictions on seed- 
ling ages that are suitable for most machines, as well as their production as mats in  
plastic trays, suggest that machine transplanted seedlings will be vulnerable to apple  
snails. For example, machine transplanting of 15-day-old rice seedlings from mat  
beds  resulted  in  70  %  missing  hills  during  a  field  experiment  in  the  Philippines  
(Horgan, unpublished). Machine transplanting of older seedlings would be advanta- 
geous for snail-infested regions. 

15.5.3        Dapog Method for Transplanting  

The dapog method is sometimes employed by farmers to reduce time involved in  
pulling  seedlings  from  seedbeds.  In  the  dapog  method,  the  seedbed  is  sown  on  
banana leaves or plastic sheets and seedlings are transplanted at 9–14 days after  
sowing. Litsinger and Estano (1993) found higher damage (about 30 % higher under  
flooded conditions) from apple snails to dapog-transplanted seedlings compared to  
using 20-day-old wet bed seedlings in fields in the Philippines. In a study by Horgan  
et al. (2014c), 100 % of 21-day-old dapog seedlings were damaged after transplant- 
ing  to  snail-infested  ponds.  Dapog  transplanting  is  now  rarely  practiced  in  the  
Philippines possibly due to nonviability of the system in snail-infested regions. 

15.5.4          Seedling Broadcasting 

The broadcasting of rice seedlings is now gaining popularity as a rice crop estab- 
lishment method in China (Tang 2002). There are four principal forms of seedling  
broadcasting. In the most popular form, seedlings are produced on dry beds with  

----------------------- Page 409-----------------------

15   Ecology and Management of Apple Snails in Rice                                                 407 

soft plastic trays. The seedlings (usually 2–4 per hill) with some soil are broadcast  
from about 2 m to puddled soil so that the roots sink by 1–1.5 cm into the mud due  
to gravity and the weight of the attached soil. Other forms of seedling broadcasting  
rely on the same broadcasting technique but with seedlings produced on either wet  
or dry beds, or using machine broadcasting of seedlings produced on dry beds in  
plastic trays. Seedling broadcasting is designed to reduce labor costs, reduce the  
land area dedicated to seed beds, and reduce the turnaround time in rice–rice and  
rice–wheat cropping systems (Tang 2002). In a recent study by Horgan et al. (2014c)  
broadcasting  of  21-day-old  seedlings  resulted  in  80  %  better  survival  and  62  %  
higher yields than transplanting of seedlings of the same age from a dry bed nursery.  
The authors suggest that a lower level of transplanting shock likely contributed to  
the  success  of  the  method.  Seedling  broadcasting  is  gaining  popularity  in Asia;  
however,  broadcasting  is  often  carried  out  with  seedlings  of  <15  days  (personal  
observation).  Further  research  is  required  to  optimize  seedling  broadcasting  for  
snail-infested regions. 

15.5.5       Direct Seeding  

In Europe, the United States, Australia, and much of Latin America, rice is gener- 
ally direct seeded (Farooq et al. 2011). Direct-seeded rice can be sown under wet or  
dry soil conditions. In dry direct seeding, dry seed is sown to dry or moist soil, often  
with a slight soil covering. The seed germinates in response to flush irrigation or  
high rainfall. Throughout much of East Asia, conditions are too wet for successful  
dry direct seeding. However, in regions with marked dry seasons, direct seeding can  
significantly reduce the costs of labor and irrigation (De Datta 1981; Sociedade Sul- 
Brasileira de Arroz Irrigado 2010; Farooq et al. 2011). A long period without stand- 
ing  water  after  sowing  can  reduce  the  vulnerability  of  dry-seeded  rice  to  apple  
snails. In an experiment by Teo (2003), dry direct seeding resulted in zero seedling  
damage from apple snails compared to 11 % in wet-direct-seeded rice and 7 % in  
transplanted rice. 
    During wet-direct seeding, the rice seed is pregerminated by soaking in water for  
24–36 h and is then left in shade for the same period of time until the coleoptiles are  
about 2 mm long before it is broadcast or mechanically seeded to flooded rice fields  
(Sociedade Sul-Brasileira de Arroz Irrigado 2010). On large rice plantations (as in  
Suriname and Brazil) pregerminated seed is sometimes broadcast using light air- 
craft (Wiryareja and Tjoe-Awie  2006). Wet seeding is preferred in some regions  
because  it  produces  dense  competitive  rice  stands  that  reduce  weed  problems  
(Sociedade Sul-Brasileira de Arroz Irrigado 2010); however, because the develop- 
ing seeds and seedlings are highly vulnerable to snail damage, even the smallest  
snails (hatchlings and juveniles) can cause serious damage to the rice stand (Wada  
2004; Yanes Figueroa et al. 2014). In a study by Horgan et al. (2014c) wet-direct-  
seeded rice failed to yield any grain in snail-infested ponds and seedling survival  
was close to 0 %.

15.5.6        Water Seeding 

Water  seeding  is  similar  to  wet-direct  seeding  except  that  the  depth  of  standing  
water  is  over  5  cm  and  the  seed  is  sown  dry  (not  pregerminated)  to  the  water  
(Sociedade Sul-Brasileira de Arroz Irrigado 2010). The method is likely to be the  
most vulnerable to snail damage because very few (low densities) and small snails  
can cause high levels of damage to developing cotyledons in a short time. 

15.6       Reducing Apple Snail Densities in Rice Fields 

Apple snails have a high reproductive output, producing clutches that range from  
maximum egg numbers of between 50 (P. glauca) and 4700 (P. maculata) (Horgan  
et al. 2014a). Furthermore, depending on climate, body size, and population density,  
a female snail may lay several clutches during her lifetime (Horgan et al. 2014a).  
Growth rates are fast and the snails may reach sexual maturity after about 60 days  
under conditions of high food availability and adequate water temperatures (Lach  
et al.  2000). In temperate regions, snails such as P. canaliculata are semelparous  
(one reproduction event per lifetime), whereas, in tropical regions, they are iteropar- 
ous (more than one reproductive event per lifetime) (Estebenet and Martin  2002;  
Seuffert et al. 2012). Growth rates and population density are linked: snails at high  
densities tend to remain relatively small (Tanaka et al.  1999) either due to direct  
intraspecific competition or regulating pheromones in the water body. Furthermore,  
apple snails can adapt quickly to ambient conditions (Seuffert et al. 2012), threats  
from predators, and other mortality factors (Reed and Janzen 1999; Aizaki and Yusa  
2010). Plasticity in the apple snail life cycle, together with high reproductive output  
and adaptability, allows apple snail populations to quickly bounce back from pertur- 
bations and hampers management practices aimed at decreasing snail populations in  
rice paddies (Table  15.2). 

15.6.1       Molluscicides  

The  most  popular  approach  to  snail  control  among  rice  farmers  is  the  use  of  
 chemical molluscicides such as methaldehyde and niclosamide (Schnorbach et al.  
2006;  Horgan  et  al.  2014b;  Khodabaks  and  Tjoe Awie  2014),  and  insecticides  
(Horgan et al. 2014b). Molluscicides are formulated poisons that directly kill snails  
either through direct contact or after ingestion. Molluscicides can be very effective  
and result in >90 % snail mortality within days of application (Litsinger and Estano  
1993). However, molluscicides have several associated risks: They are toxic to ben- 
eficial organisms including fish and birds (Calumpang et al.  1995; Baumart et al.  
2011),  they  are  harmful  to  human  health  (Anderson   1993),  and  some  are  

----------------------- Page 411-----------------------

15   Ecology and Management of Apple Snails in Rice                                                409 

phytotoxic and can damage young rice seedlings (Joshi et al. 2004). Furthermore,  
apple snails in molluscicide-treated fields are often notably larger that in nontreated  
fields because survivors after application have faster growth rates at lower popula- 
tion densities (personal observation). Because apple snails are a perpetual problem  
in invaded regions and because they are aquatic in nature, the continuous applica- 
tion  of  molluscicides  must  be  avoided.  Several  researchers  have  attempted  to  
develop   more   environmentally   friendly   molluscicides   to   replace   damaging  
chemicals. 
    A range of plant extracts with molluscicidal properties have been identified to  
replace toxic chemical products (San 2006; Yang et al. 2006; Chen et al. 2012; Li  
and Xu 2012). Among these, tea tree meal, a byproduct of oil extraction from seeds  
of the tea plant (Camellia sasanqua Thunb.) has become popular in some countries  
and is noted to give good snail control with up to 95 % mortality (Yang et al. 2006).  
Extracts of several other plant species have also been developed to control apple  
snails:   These   include   quinoa   (Chenopodium   quinoa   Willd.),   Solanum   spp.,  
Eucalyptus spp., and others (San 2006; Li and Xu 2012). Many of these products are  
still restricted for use in some countries because of difficulties in registration for  
agricultural use and because their risks to the environment and human health have  
not been evaluated. The products have variable success in reducing snail damage:  
Their efficiency may depend on the conditions of the water, including water tem- 
perature  and  dissolved  oxygen.  Furthermore,  some  botanical  extracts  may  have  
lethal effects on beneficial aquatic organisms, including fish and decomposer inver- 
tebrates (i.e., tea saponins: Yang et al.  2006; Chen et al. 2012); however, several  
botanical products, e.g., quinoa saponins, appear considerably less toxic than chem- 
ical molluscicides and represent a step toward improving the sustainable manage- 
ment of apple snails (San 2006). 

15.6.2       Fertilizers  

Fertilizers, including urea, complete fertilizer and calcium cyanamide have been  
noted to kill apple snails under laboratory and field conditions (Wada 2004; De la  
Cruz et al. 2001; Zhao et al. 2011; Stuart et al. 2014). Calcium cyanamide is pro- 
posed as a relatively environment friendly approach to snail management that is  
potentially  highly  effective,  e.g.,  100  %  mortality  at  3gL−1  (Zhao  et  al.  2011).  

Applications of nitrogenous fertilizers have also been noted to cause snail mortality,  
possibly due to toxic effects after ingestion. Under certain conditions, mortality due  
to nitrogenous fertilizers can be as high as 60–80 % (De la Cruz et al. 2001; Stuart  
et al. 2014). To help control apple snails, farmers can increase the concentrations of  
fertilizer products during basal applications, select the most toxic fertilizers such as  
complete fertilizer, urea or mixed products, and reduce flooding of the rice fields  
during application (De la Cruz et al. 2001; Stuart et al. 2014). However, such prac- 
tices are likely to affect beneficial organisms in the water, alter the structures of  
animal and plant communities (Vitousek  1994), and must be carefully balanced to

avoid run-off and eutrophication. Furthermore, snail population recovery may be  
accelerated by high plant biomass, including the biomass of periphyton and algae  
that develops after fertilizer use (Stuart et al. 2014). 

15.6.3        Crop Rotation and Fallow Periods 

A range of cropping practices has been examined to potentially reduce apple snail  
densities. Among these are crop rotations and extended, dry fallow periods (Wada  
2004; Wada et al. 2004). Apple snails have evolved to inhabit ephemeral water bod- 
ies and therefore have a high capacity to survive dry conditions. The snails normally  
burrow a few centimeters into the mud where they enter aestivation. Aestivation can  
last for several months; however, mortality increases over time (Yusa et al. 2006a).  
To cause any appreciable mortality of apple snails, dry fallows should be longer  
than about 4 months. This can result in >90 % and 50 % mortality of small and large  
snails, respectively (Yusa et al. 2006a). Long-term drainage will be most effective  
under hot dry conditions (Yusa et al. 2006a) but can have variable impact on snail  
populations because of microclimates in the rice fields and the rapid recovery of  
snail  populations  after  flooding.  Land  preparation  between  crops  can  also  cause  
considerable snail mortality. For example, using an adapted rotary cultivator, 90 %  
mortality of large  P. canaliculata and 25 % mortality of smaller individuals has  
been  achieved  in  Japanese  rice  fields  (Wada  2004).  The  success  of  mechanical  
crushing depends on the soil type and soil conditions, for example, mortality from  
mechanical crushing can be 14–20 % higher in fields that are compacted after rice  
harvest (Wada 2004). 

15.6.4       Hand Collecting  

Manual collection of apple snails is often conducted among small-holder farmers  
prior  to  transplanting.  During  collection,  farmers  and  farm  laborers  will  walk  
through the fields collecting any snails that they see. These are generally the largest  
snails with the greatest potential to cause damage. Picking can increase seedling  
survival by 20–50 % even for singly planted, 18-day-old seedlings (Yanes Figueroa  
et al. 2014). However, picking is labor intensive, conducted with variable intensity,  
and is not suitable for large farms. Hand picking is also best conducted during cooler  
and cloudy conditions because the snails burrow in mud during high temperatures  
(Wada and Yoshida 2000). There is also some evidence that continuous picking may  
lead to the selection for cryptic shell colors in snail populations (M Türke  2014,  
personal communication). Picking can be improved by using baits such as the leaves  
of sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas [L.]) or other plants that attract the snails to one  
place,  or  by  using  drainage  canals  (Wada  2004).  Furthermore,  in  some  regions,  
farmers use rakes and baskets to facilitate snail  collection (Fig.  15.3).

     The collection and destruction of egg masses may be a more effective way of  
reducing densities but the success of the method has not been evaluated. The brightly  
colored eggs of apple snails are easy to find and, by placing wooden stakes in the  
fields for snails to deposit their eggs, they can be collected quickly. Collection of  
apple snails and their eggs would benefit from further economic incentives, e.g.,  
selling snail meat as a protein source for farmed fish or poultry (Cagauan and Doria  
1989; Bombeo-Tubaran et al. 1995). 

15.6.5          Biological Control on Integrated Farms  

Several biological control methods have been proposed to reduce apple snail densi- 
ties in rice fields (Joshi and Sebastian 2006). Integrated farms often produce ducks  
or fish together with rice in flooded paddies. Ducks can be herded through rice fields  
to  feed  on  snails,  other  invertebrates,  and  weeds  (Teo  2001).  Duck  herding  is

common in many South and East Asian countries with farmers often inviting duck  
herders to visit their fields. The effectiveness of the method in reducing snail densi- 
ties is difficult to determine and may depend on the breed of duck (Teo 2001). Hirai  
(Naylor  1996) claims that ducks consume up to 89 % of apple snails on passing  
through rice fields; however, this likely refers only to their effects on larger snails. 
    Rice–fish culture is practiced in many lowland rice-growing regions, particu- 
larly in Asia. Rice–fish cultures require deep reservoirs to be constructed in the  
fields  as  refuges,  allowing  the  fish  to  forage  among  the  rice  plants  only  during  
periods of flooding. The effectiveness of fish predation depends on the species of  
fish and the size (or gape) of the mouth (Ichinose et al. 2010). A number of studies  
have found common carp (Cyprinus carpio L.) to reduce snail densities (Teo 2006;  
Wong et al. 2009; Ichinose et al. 2010); however, the common carp is also an inva- 
sive species and can significantly alter freshwater habitats by reducing macrophyte  
density and the abundance of native benthic organisms (Wong et al.  2009). The  
success of several other fish species in reducing snail densities or protecting devel- 
oping rice seedlings has been generally low (Halwart  1994; Teo 2001; Ichinose  
et al. 2010). It is possible that the rice–fish systems need to be established for rela- 
tively long periods (several cropping seasons) before snail populations are effec- 
tively regulated by the fish. 
    Dong et al. (2012) report that farmers in Zheizhang China have adopted a system  
of  turtle  (Pelodiscus  sinensis  [Weigmann])-zazania  (Zizania  latifolia  [Griseb]  
Turcz) culture that reduces apple snail densities. Zezania is a high-value “wild rice”  
and the turtles can also be sold for meat in local markets. The turtles were noted to  
reduce  snail  densities  and  the  system  was  sufficiently  lucrative  for  farmers  to  
 establish large enclosures for the turtles. Biological control using ducks, fish, or  
turtles has potential, but is limited by marketability of ducks, eggs, or fish meat and  
is likely to remain small scale. 

15.6.6       Classical and New Association Biological Control 

Classical  biological  control  of  apple  snails  has  received  little  research  attention.  
There have been a few studies on the potential for using predatory flies (Fu and  
Meyer-Rochow 2012) and pathogenic bacteria (Chobchuenchom and Bhumiratana  
2003) to control snails; however, these ideas have not been implemented among  
farmers. There is good potential to enhance biological control through new associa- 
tions between native diseases or predators and exotic apple snails. Predation and  
regulation of apple snails by native species has been examined in detail in Japan.  
Several  wild  animals  including  crayfish  (Procambarus  clarkia  [Girard]),  crabs  
(Eriocheir   japonicas   [de   Haan]   and   Gerthelphusa   dehaani   [White]),   turtles   
(P. sinensis, Trachemys scripta [Schoepff], Mauremys reevesii [Gray] and Mauremys  
japonica  [Temminck and Schlegel]), and rats (Rattus norvegicus [Berkenhout]) will  
feed on snails and may play a role in reducing snail densities in natural areas (Yusa  
et al. 2006b; Yamanishi et al. 2012). Furthermore, it appears that over time, apple

snails have accumulated natural enemies in Japan as local wildlife have adapted to  
feed  on  and  consume  the  snails.  Snail  kites,  Rostrhamus  sociabilis  Vieillot,  in  
Ecuador and open bill storks, Anastomus oscitans (Boddaert), in Thailand have built  
up populations in response to the invasion of rice fields by apple snails (Sawangproh  
et al. 2012; Horgan et al. 2014b). Predation is highest in natural habitats including  
ponds and rivers, but can be low in rice paddies because farming activities will kill  
or displace natural enemies, particularly at the time of land preparation (Burlakova  
et al. 2010; Yamanishi et al. 2012). 

15.7       Concluding Remarks 

Despite widespread knowledge of the risks associated with apple snails, several spe- 
cies, including species known to damage rice, continue to be imported into rice-  
producing  countries,  mainly  for  the  pet  trade  (Coelho  et  al.  2012).  Strict  and  
effective quarantine of apple snails should be a priority in major rice-growing areas  
that are vulnerable to apple snails, including India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Peru,  
and Colombia. Furthermore, the feasibility of wet- direct seeding should be reexam- 
ined. While crop establishment methods that are suitable for snail-infested or native  
regions exist, it will be hard to justify continuing research and extension aimed at  
promoting direct-seeding methods that rely heavily on molluscicides. Research into  
alternatives to, or adaptations of direct seeding, could greatly improve country and  
regional preparedness for apple snails.

Harvesting, Threshing, Processing,  
and Products of Rice

16.1       Introduction 

Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is one of the most important food items consumed by more  
than half of the world population as staple diet. Globally, the rough rice (paddy)  
stands at position second with a total production of 740.9 metric tons from 154 mil- 
lion hectare, almost 90 % of which is grown in developing countries (FAOSTAT  
2013), while it stands first at human consumption scale with 85 % utilization com- 
pared to wheat (72 %) and maize (19 %). Rice provides 21 % and 19 % of the global  
human per capita energy and protein, respectively (FAO 2012). It is estimated that 10  
billion people will depend on rice as a major source of their meal increasing the  
demand up to 880 metric tons by 2050 (FAO 2015). In order to cope with the situa- 
tion,  multiple  strategies  have  been  adopted  to  increase  the  production  of  rice  by  
developing  high  yielding,  drought,  insect,  and  disease  resistance  varieties.  The  
increase in rice production due to crop management is hardly compensating in yield  
reduction on account of urbanization and industrialization persuaded decline in the

cereal crops has been steadily declined from 3.2 % per year in 1960 to 1.5 % in 2000  
(FAO 2015). Moreover, postharvest losses of crops range from 10 to 20 % in devel- 
oped, while 25 to 40 % in developing countries. These losses in rice are particularly

associated with socioeconomic development of farmers, awareness, and adoption of  
the  latest  and  improved  methods  of  production,  harvesting,  milling,  and  storage.  
Lack of awareness among farmers on weather forecast, latest methods of harvesting,  
time of harvesting, milling, and storage conditions due to illiteracy are the major  
contributors for too high losses of crops in developing countries. Policy makers, sci- 
entists, and stake holders associated with production and management have focused  
on the quantitative losses of rice since the last quarter of the twentieth century giving  
meager consideration to the qualitative losses of the crops. It is among the reasons  
that the qualitative losses of rice crop are getting more attention in the most recent  
era. Many of the research organizations, policy makers, and financial support agen- 
cies have already set their targets to achieve the milestone of better production by  
developing high yielding rice cultivars, improved methods of harvesting, threshing,  
milling, and storage to curtail postharvest losses. The developed countries although  
have attained maximum production of rice with the development of high yielding  
varieties, best agronomic practices, and adoption of good agricultural, harvesting,  
transportation, and storage practices. However, the developing countries could con- 
tribute  to  significant  rise  in  rice  production  by  improving  cropping  intensity  and  
expansion of arable land in addition to reduce postharvest losses. Rice production in  
proper moisture conditions and nutrient availability, harvesting fully matured grains  
at moisture levels below 26 % and subsequent mechanical drying upto15% moisture  
level, milling through pneumatic rubber rolls, storage under controlled environmen- 
tal conditions, and integrated insect and pest management programs are the factors  
that  can  reduce  quantitative  and  qualitative  losses  in  rice  crop  (Bell  et  al.  2000).  
Increasing production of rice by putting lot of capital and investment on research is  
a good sign but a little effort to curtail the postharvest losses of rice can save cost and  
energy and might further increase the total turnout from the crop. The applications  
for advanced and latest techniques of rice harvesting, milling, transportation, and  
storage can reduce the losses up to a compromising level. The current chapter has  
been written with the objective to discuss the various techniques universally adopted  
for harvesting, drying, milling, and storage. This chapter discusses methods of mill- 
ing in detail with a focus to improve the understanding of both the farmer and the rice  
processor to adopt best crop management practices. Moreover, various factors con- 
tributing toward quality of rice are also enlightened in a way that the reader with a  
little background knowledge may understand how to prepare a better quality of rice  
and how milling recovery is to be increased. 

16.2       Harvesting and Threshing 

Rice harvesting is a process of whole grain recovery utilizing a chain of mechanized  
operations  from  crop  cutting  up  to  threshing.  The  process  involves  recovery  of  
matured rice from the field and generally comprises operations like stalk cutting,  
stacking,  handling,  and  transportation  on  threshing  blades.  Threshing  of  rice  
involves separating grains from panicles without removing husk. Such methods of

16   Harvesting, Threshing, Processing, and Products of Rice                             421 

harvesting and threshing are adopted universally, which maximize grain recovery,  
minimize harvesting losses, and improve the straw yield. The straw serves as dry  
forage for milking and meat animals. The crop harvesting time and procedures are  
reportedly    associated   with   certain   important    qualitative  attributes   of  rice.  
Mechanized harvesting at an appropriate time ensures improved paddy quality and  
grain yield by avoiding lodging, over drying of grains, shattering, rodent and bird  
attack, and soil contamination (Van den Berg et al. 2007). Indicators showing the  
correct timing of rice harvesting include yellowing of panicles, 20–26 % moisture  
contents of grains, and recovery of at least 80 % matured grains from the panicles  
(Almera  1997). The method of rice harvesting depends upon many factors such as  
ecology, size of the field and cultivated area, cultural practices, social and economic  
status of the farmers, climatic conditions at the time of harvesting, availability of  
labor, access to the market, market demand, and usage of the straw. 

Rice Variety    Some varieties are prone to lodging hence their panicles are bowed to  
ground and cannot be picked up by combine or machine harvesters. Hence to avoid  
harvesting losses, manual harvesting is preferred over mechanized harvesting for  
cultivars with poor field standing capability. 

Timeliness of harvesting      It is the time for which the variety can stay unharvested  
after ripening. On account of low cost labor availability and higher timeline of the  
variety, manual rice crop harvesting is preferred over mechanized harvesting. 

Environmental  conditions        If  environmental  conditions  worsen,  then  quick  and  
mechanized harvesting is preferred over manual harvesting. 

Availability of labor    In regions with higher availability of cheaper labor, manual  
harvesting is preferred over mechanical to curtail harvesting expenditures of the crop. 

Access to the field or farm       If the farm has no access for combined or machine  
harvesting, then manual method of harvesting is preferred. 

Market  demand        The  paddy  harvested  through  manual  harvesting  is  usually  
cleaner than that mechanically harvested, having less moisture and higher percent- 
age of matured grains. There are reports that higher demands are raised by industry  
for manually harvested paddy for the sake of better milling and cooking quality  
attributes; however, highly trained labor is required for manual harvesting to mini- 
mize the losses (Khan and Salim 2005). 

Demand of straw      In developing countries, paddy straw is usually used as fodder  
and to make silage for animal feed. The waste fraction is also used for making fire  
in the pottery, brick, and tile industry and as raw material for mats manufacturing.  
Hence, paddy is harvested manually if there are higher demands to save the straw in  
its original form. 

   Following methods are globally used for harvesting and threshing of rice crop.

16.3      Manual Methods 

This is an oldest and the primitive method of rice harvesting that involves intensive  
human resources. Manual harvesting is laborious, very slow, and time consuming;  
however, it is very cheap compared to the other available harvesting techniques, par- 
ticularly where cheaper labor is available. The rice crop is manually harvested usu- 
ally in uplands, small farms, and under developed areas where access to the harvesters  
is poor. In the manual harvesting, knives, sickles, or cutlasses are used for cutting the  
crop (Bora and Hansen  2007). In knife cutting, the harvesting is done panicle by  
panicle that makes harvesting much more laborious and time consuming. Sickle or  
cutlasses method involves the cutting of whole plant and hence less labor is required  
in this method than the former one. The paddy harvested manually or with reaper is  
usually spread on dry earth floor for field drying that have higher risks of contamina- 
tion with mud, mold, dust, dirt, and stones. In order to avoid postharvest losses and  
damages to the field crop quality, plastic sheets, tarpaulins, or traditional sheets may  
be used. The semidried panicles are tied into bundles of around 10 inch diameter by  
a crew of two to three persons. The bundles are stacked into small piles and collected  
at a central point of the field where it is threshed by any means. Multiple threshing  
techniques are deployed for the purpose and the most primitive among these is manu- 
ally beating freshly cut or semidried panicles onto the solid surface either made of  
mud, wood or iron (Fig. 16.1). Another manual method of threshing of rice is to beat  
bundles of rice with a device generally called as flail. In some very under developed  
regions, rice grains are also been separated by forcing animals to walk on the heaps  
of semidried harvested panicles. The same technique had also been adopted by the  
farmers by replacing animals with tractors having rubber tires. 

16.4      Mechanical Methods 

Mechanical  harvesting  and  threshing  has  many  benefits  over  manual  harvesting  on  
account of managing the crops in a very short period of time, harvesting the crop even  
at more than 20 % moisture contents, reduced labor involvement, appreciable reduction  
in spoilage, and higher grain yield or output. However, the crop has to be dried as early  
as possible after harvesting to avoid losses incurred due to higher rate of respiration of  
the harvested grains. Following mechanical methods are commonly used globally. 

16.5      Harvesting with Reapers 

Reapers are an intermediate technology between manual and combine harvesting and  
are deployed to facilitate crop harvesting. Reapers are of two types including reaper- 
cutter and reaper-binder. Reaper-cutter is a tractor front driven machine that reaps and

Fig. 16.1   Various stages of manual harvesting and threshing 

makes windrows of the harvested crop. The machine comprises a cutting bench, tra- 
versing conveyor, reel, reciprocating cutter, crop-lifter, and divider board. The crop  
passes the divider board and the reel, while reciprocating cutters cut it above the ground  
level. Traversing conveyor moves it to one side of the reaper in the form of row. The  
harvested paddy crop is tied into bundles manually after it is dried in the field, provided  
that the reaper is not combined with binder. The machine is compact and easy to oper- 
ate and maintain. A single machine can harvest 0.3–0.4 hectare standing crop per hour.  
The reaper–binder is similar to reaper cutter with the addition of a binder in which the  
harvested paddy crop is tied into bundles mechanically. The machine has a working  
capacity of 0.5–20 h per hectare (Khan and Salim 2005). Paddy from the harvested rice  
stalks is further separated either by manual or mechanical threshing.

16.6       Rice Threshers 

Two types of threshers are available on the globe including whole feed and half feed  
for separating paddy from the panicles. In the whole feed thresher, paddy with straw  
is fed through the hopper or feed table. The drum containing teeth is rotated through  
an engine via a V-belt pulley. The spike teeth cylinder and the concave sieve are the  
main sections of thresher that take part in threshing. The grains passing through  
concave sieve are collected in the grain collector and are propelled to the outlet  
elbow by grain propeller. The reflecting plate throws the straw from the rotating  
cylinder in a tangential direction. In half feed thresher the paddy straw is fed in such  
a way that only panicle part strikes with the rotating cylinder while keeping the  
paddy stalks in hand. The grain free stalks are heaped separately. The efficiency of  
half feed thresher is very low compared to the full feed threshers; however, they  
consume less power for their working. 

16.7       Combine Harvester 

Combine harvester is a multipurpose machine that carries all necessary makeup to  
execute  crop  harvesting  and  threshing  operations  including  cutting,  conveying,  
threshing, separation, and cleaning processes spontaneously (Fig.  16.2). Combine  
harvesters  have  higher  working  efficiency  and  are  less  laborious.  However,  it  is  
quite complicated and expensive technique for illiterate and small farmers having  
meager  resources  to  manage  harvesting  operations  and  poor  access  to  on  field  
equipment services. Combine harvester operates mainly on hydraulic system and  
some controllers and, regulators. It is classified into wheel and claw combine har- 
vesters depending on the type of mechanism for its mobility while straight-through  
and  head-feed  combines  on  the  basis  of  feeding  pattern.  In  the  straight-through  
machine, the cut crop with stem is fed into the cylinder for threshing, cleaning, and

separation. While in head-feed combine, the cut straw is held by a clamping mecha- 
nism and only the panicle part is fed into the thresher for threshing. The former has  
a higher efficiency, while the latter can generate whole straw that may be utilized as  
farm feed or industrial raw material for multiple purposes. Straight-through har- 
vester is commonly used in developing countries and its working may be divided  
into following six sections. 

Cutting  Section     This  unit  cuts  the  crop  and  delivers  it  to  the  feeding  section  
through a conveyor system. The section comprises of a reel for supporting the grain  
part of the rice stalk against the cutter bar. The cutter bar cuts the crop just below the  
grain part, i.e., heads; hence, this section is also called as head section. The dividers  
separate the standing crop and bind the swath to be cut by the cutter bar. 

Feeding Section      This part comprises of a conveyor system that carries the har- 
vested crop from the cutter bar to the threshing cylinder. 

Threshing Section      This section comprises of a cylinder, concaves, and grates. The  
grains are separated from the straw while passing in between the cylinder and con- 
caves. The concaves are the stationary bars and are extended across the full width and  
surrounded about one-quarter of the cylinder. The grates are the openings or perfora- 
tions in between the concaves to separate the threshed grains. The threshed grains are  
collected in the grain pan beneath the basement of threshing section, while the straw  
traveling to full length of rack is discharged at rear end of the machine. 

Separating Section      Small pieces of straw are mixed with grains and pass through  
the grates particularly at the rear end of the threshing section. The mass of straw is  
separated from the grains by the straw-rack, which tosses and tumbles straw and  
propels it to the rear end. 

Cleaning Section      This section removes chaff and fine residues from the threshed  
grains collected at the end of the concave and the straw walker by the combined  
action of the sieve installed above the grain pan and the blower. 

Grain Collecting Section      This section conveys the grain to the point from where it is  
taken out for packing at the grain tank. A clean grain auger is the extended part of the  
grain pan at the bottom of the threshing section that conveys the grains to auger elevator.  
The auger elevator elevates the cleaned grains and throws into the grain tank. The grain  
tank is then emptied and the grains are packed in the desired packaging material. 

16.8      Rice Processing 

Rice processing includes a series of operations from crop harvesting to the finished  
rice product ready for onward marketing or consumption (Fig.  16.3). Rice process- 
ing generally involves paddy drying, dehusking, milling, and packaging. However,

Fig. 16.3   Flow diagrams of paddy drying, husking and rice milling 

a high degree of variability exists in rice processing depending upon type of the  
product developed from paddy. Rice milling and cooking qualities are primarily  
dependent upon a rapid and efficient method of drying. 

Paddy Drying        Rice grains at harvesting may have a moisture content ranging from  
20 to 26 % (Siebenmorgen et al. 2007). Harvesting at high moisture levels is aimed  
at avoiding grain shattering and crop loss. Delay in harvesting results in field drying  
of standing crop generating cracks in the grains that further results in a higher bro- 
ken kernel output. Process of paddy drying preserves innate quality attributes of  
rice. It is therefore recommended that the rice crop after harvesting and threshing  
may be dried up to the safe moisture contents. Paddy having moisture contents up  
to 15–16 % may be stored for 3–6 months while for longer period of storage, mois- 
ture contents can further be lowered to 12 % (Genkawa et al. 2008). Paddy having  
12–13 % moisture contents is considered to be the best for milling and head rice  
recovery, while moisture contents beyond this limit may cause high breakage and  
low yield consequently a significant economic loss to the miller (Ali et al.  1990;  
Siebenmorgen et al. 1998; Surek and Beser 1998; Hossain et al. 2009).

    Quantity  of  the  stock,  initial  moisture  contents,  storage  temperature,  relative  
humidity, speed and volume of the air passing thorough the paddy, drying method,  
type of the drier, and drying efficiency of the driers are the major factors that can  
affect paddy drying process. Paddy being hygroscopic in nature may gain and loose  
moisture; therefore, tempering of paddy is required to equilibrate the moisture con- 
tents of the grain. Tempering is the process in which the paddy grains are collected  
together to equalize the moisture contents between the grains. Various methods have  
been employed to dry the paddy including sun drying and mechanical drying. The  
most  common,  cheaper  and  primitive  method  for  paddy  drying  particularly  
employed in temperate and tropical areas is sun drying. Freshly threshed paddy is  
spread over the water proof floor in thin layers early in the morning and collected on  
sunset each day and the process is continued until moisture contents reduce to the  
desired  level.  It  is  better  to  spread  the  paddy  in  thin  layers  of  6  cm.  One  acre  
          2 
(4000 m ) dry insulated field can handle 60 ton of paddy for drying at one time, and  
drying may be completed in 2–3 days depending upon the initial and desired final  
moisture  contents,  exposure  hours,  intensity  of  heat,  and  humidity  in  air.  In  the  
developing countries, roofs of the houses are used for the purpose at home scale,  
while leveled and mud-varnished dried fields are used for drying at the industrial  
scale. The cost of the method is dependent on the availability of the labor, socioeco- 
nomic conditions, and climatic conditions of the region. Sun drying is advantageous  
on account of initial and operational cost. 
    Adverse  climatic  conditions  are  barrier  to  the  sun  drying  process;  hence,  
mechanical  drying  is  employed  as  alternate  to  sun  drying  and,  for  holding  the  
paddy, heating and blowing the dried air through the mass of moistened grains. A  
range of mechanical dryers are used for the purpose. These may be divided into  
three  groups  including  batch-in-bin,  recirculating  batch,  and  continuous  flow  
dryers. 
    Batch-in-bin is the simplest small-scale mechanical drying technique applicable  
at village or farm level as well as at large scale for industrial paddy drying. Paddy  
drying in this technique is carried out in a bin equipped with perforated base that  
allows dried air to pass from the bottom through the entire stored stock. The bin is  
emptied for refilling with fresh stock when desired level of moisture of paddy is  
gained. The recirculating batch is like the batch-in-bin type dryer with the exception  
that it has a system for circulating the paddy in the bin. Recirculating batch drying  
is more efficient on account of better milling quality of paddy. 
    In the continuous flow type dryer, the paddy is dropped from the top of the dryer  
column, while hot air enters at the bottom of the drying chamber. Baffles in continu- 
ous flow type dryers are constructed in such a way that they create hurdle in free fall  
of the paddy in drying chamber. The speed of the paddy falling through the dryer  
chamber may be controlled by tilting the baffles up to the desired angle. The dryer  
is designed in such a way that paddy takes around 15–30 minutes to reach from top  
to the bottom. The paddy after drying is sent to a temporary storage bin for 48–72 h  
for tempering (Taechapairoj et al. 2007). Continuous flow dryers have a holding bin  
at the top of the drying chamber, a flow control system to control the passage of  
paddy, and systems for heating and blowing the dried air. This method is employed

when a large volume of wet paddy is to be dried. The initial cost for installation of  
continuous flow dryers is too high but working efficiency compensates its cost. 

16.9      Paddy Cleaning 

Foreign matters like sand, stones, straw, mud, weed seeds, iron particles, and stitch- 
ing ropes may become part of paddy during harvesting, threshing, and transporta- 
tion. Removal of such material is called paddy cleaning. Paddy is passed through  
precleaner  and  destoner  for  the  purpose  of  removal  of  such  foreign  debris.  The  
process of precleaning not only cleans rice but also reduces the risk of wear and tear  
of the milling machinery. There are various types of globally used precleaners that  
work on the basic principle of aspiration for the removal of lighter particles from the  
paddy, sieving for separation on the basis of size and shape and gravity separation.  
Impurities like sand, dust, small stones, soil particles, and weed seeds are separated  
by aspiration. Larger and smaller particles than paddy grains may be separated by  
sieves having grooves of various sizes. Particles having same size but heavier than  
paddy grains can be separated by gravity separation. Iron particles are separated by  
gravity separation, by sieving or by permanent or electromagnets (Dhankhar 2014).  
Three major types of precleaners used in industry include open double-sieve pre- 
cleaner, single-action aspirator-precleaner, and single-drum precleaner. 

Open double-sieve precleaner          Paddy is inserted from the top of the machine on  
the upper sieve having larger perforations than paddy size. Paddy along with small  
foreign particles is dropped on the lower screen having perforations smaller than the  
paddy grains. This action removes straw and chaff fractions from the paddy; how- 
ever, particles smaller than paddy are further separated and dropped through the  
lower screen. Open double screen precleaner is too simple to be handled but still  
there exists risk of clogging of perforations with dust that is needed to be monitored  
adequately for higher throughput of the cleaner. 

Single-action aspirator precleaner        It comprises of a stationary section, oscillating  
section, and a suction fan connected to a cyclone. The stationary section is fixed in  
wooden or iron frame housing with a suction fan connected to a cyclone. Paddy is  
inserted from the top near the housing and dust is removed by suction fan. The flow  
of the grain in aspirator cleaner and speed of suction air are adjusted to their maxi- 
mum efficiency for removal of dust and lighter particles. The remaining two sieves  
of aspirator cleaner have the same function as of open double sieve precleaner. This  
is a closed type precleaner having minimum risks of clogging of sieves. 

Single-drum precleaner        It consists of a vibrating inclined screen, a horizontal rotat- 
ing cylinder covered with a wire screen of larger mesh size, air suction fan connected  
to cyclone, and double oscillating sieves fixed in iron or wood frame. Paddy is inserted  
via vibrating inclined screen into the rotating cylinder from the top to remove larger

impurities. Paddy along with smaller impurities passes through upper sieve in the  
form of a film. The suction fan removes the dust from the film and delivers it to the  
cyclone. The upper screen removes larger impurities, while paddy grains along with  
smaller impurities are dropped to bottom screen. The smaller impurities are dropped  
to the bottom screen while overflowing the cleaned paddy to the destoner. Magnets are  
installed to remove iron particles at the inlet or outlet housing of the precleaner. 

Destoner    Stones similar in size to paddy grains are difficult to remove through  
paddy cleaners; hence destoners having a perforated deck mounted with an angle  
and aspiration facility are used. The air stratifies the particles while the reciprocat- 
ing motion of the deck removes the stones at lifted back end and cleaned paddy is  
separated at the lower end of destoner. 

16.10       Dehulling 

The process of removal of paddy husk is called dehulling or dehusking. Various types  
of hullers or huskers are used with the objective to remove husk from paddy. The most  
common types are steel huller, under-run disc huller, and rubber rollers. The steel  
huller is the first mechanical type of huller having disadvantages like higher percent- 
age of breakage, lower head rice recovery, and requirement of high electric power. 
   Under-run disc huller also called as disk huller is made of two horizontal iron  
discs. One of the disc housing of dehuller is fixed in iron case, while the second one  
rotates. The paddy grains are dropped from the hopper to the center of hullers under  
gravitational force and husk is removed from the surface of paddy while passing  
between the two roller under the centrifugal pressure and friction of the discs. The  
space between the two discs can be adjusted by the rotating disc according to the  
moisture  contents,  type,  size,  and  condition  of  the  paddy  with  the  objective  of  
 minimum breakage and maximum recovery. The disc shellers although have many  
advantages over steel hullers including low operational cost, cheaper maintenance,  
and operational simplicity. However, due to high breakage rate, requirement of high  
electric power, lower capacities of hulling, excessive removal of germ, damage to  
the bran layer, and, requirement of an extra step of sieving make them rather less  
economical compared to the rubber rollers. 
   Rubbers rollers are widely used in the rice industry now-a-days. The rubber roll  
paddy husker comprises of two rolls rotating in opposite directions but with differ- 
ential speed. The husk from the paddy grains is easily removed by shearing action  
of the rolls. The speed and space between the two rolls are adjustable to get maxi- 
mum recovery of the head rice. The rubber rolls have many advantages over all  
other types of rollers including lower rate of breakage, lower rate of germ removal,  
and minimum loss to the bran layer, improved hulling efficiency, and negligible  
brew production that eliminates needs of sieving. Only disadvantage of rubber roll- 
ers is the cost of their replacement on account of faster wear and tear of rubber  
compared to steel or disc hullers.

16.11       Husk Separation 

Huskers produce a mixture of brown rice, unhusked paddy grains, husk, brew, and  
germ. Husk is separated by the process of aspiration. The dehusking process generates  
broken kernels, brew, and germs from the paddy. If paddy is hulled through steel or  
disk type hullers then these products are separated from each other in three different  
steps. These fractions are passed through the plane sifter consisting of a set of two  
screens and a blower at the bottom. The top screen separates the husk, unhulled paddy,  
and head rice into a hopper at the bottom of the plane sifter. The aspirator at the bot- 
tom pulls air through the mixture and throws husk outside the blower. The immature  
and lighter grains while moving with the air are dropped into a hopper due to negative  
air pressure. The broken kernels move through the upper screen, while the brews and  
germs  are  separated  by  the  bottom  screen. The  unhulled  paddy  and  head  rice  are  
passed onto the paddy separator. Since housing of rubber rollers carry blower, husk is  
separated just after dehusking while the remaining products including unhulled paddy  
grains, head, and broken rice are moved to the paddy separator (Tangpinijkul 2010). 

16.12       Paddy Separation 

The unhulled paddy grains are compulsory to be separated from the rice before milling.  
Mixture of paddy grains, broken, and brown rice are sent to the paddy husker that sepa- 
rates the paddy grains from the other fractions. Paddy grains having larger volume to  
mass ratio possess less specific gravity compared to brown rice. Moreover, due to coarse  
surface of husk, paddy grains have high resistance in mobility. Hence, the paddy grains  
are separated from hulled rice by the to and fro motion in tilted position of paddy separa- 
tors. Two types of paddy separators are being employed in rice processing industry. 

Compartment type separator            These are prototype mechanical separators made  
of steel or wood having 10–80 compartments housed in 2–4 decks. The mixture of  
unhulled paddy and rice is fed on the top through the hopper to a channel that dis- 
tributes it evenly in the compartments. Unhulled paddy as a result of oscillating  
motion is separated and fed to the hullers for dehusking again while the rice along  
with broken kernels is transferred to a width grader for the separation of head rice.  
Efficiency comparison of different separators confirms the compartment-type sepa- 
rators as the cheaper ones, requiring less energy and operating cost; however, they  
need large space and strong foundation for installation. 

Tray Separator       It consists of a set of trays housed one above the other, and all  
fixed in a frame made of steel. The assembly is attached in a tilting position to a base  
operated  by  an  electric  motor.  The  paddy  grains  are  dropped  onto  the  screens  
through an inward hopper. The tray section moves up and forward making a slight  
jumping  movement.  The  brown  rice  having  smooth  surface  and  larger  density  
moves toward the upper and forward end while paddy to the lower forward end. The  
brown rice separated is moved toward plane sifter for separation of broken rice,  

----------------------- Page 432-----------------------

16   Harvesting, Threshing, Processing, and Products of Rice                               431 

brew, or germs. The head rice is separated while the mixture of broken and head rice  
is sent to the length grader (Van Ruiten  1976). 

16.13       Length Grading 

Broken grains have smaller length as compared to whole grains or head rice and are  
separated through length grader, also called as trieurs, rotating cylinders, and drum  
graders. A length grader comprises of two half-circled indented screens fitted in such  
a way as to make a cylinder, a catch trough having a screw conveyor, and a rotation  
controller. The length grader is installed in an inclined position to add a slight push  
to  the  head  rice  for  easy  removal  from  the  grader.  The  broken  kernel  packed  in  
indents reach the top with the rotation of the cylinder, dropped in the trough, and  
pushed out of the cylinder by screw conveyor. Length graders on the basis of number  
of stages may be classified as single stage, two stage, and three stage length graders.  
The broken percentage in the final rice may be reduced up to a desired level by con- 
trolling the rotation speed of the cylinder and type of the length grader. 

16.14       Width Grading 

Width  graders  are  the  circulating  cylinders  made  with  a  perforated  iron  or  steel  
sheet housed over a rotating shaft. These graders are used to separate rice on the  
basis of width and are installed in slightly tilted position. Width graders are used for  
separating rice grains and foreign particles having size greater than normal rice. The  
oversized width graders have screens with perforations of size slightly more than  
the normal rice width (Gariboldi  1974). Rice fed into the rotating cylinder while  
passing through the perforations drops into a trough at the bottom. A screw con- 
veyor in the trough pushes rice outside of the trough while oversized rice retained in  
the  cylinder  is  pushed  outside  due  to  tilted  rotation  of  the  cylinder.  Undersized  
width graders are used to remove thin and shriveled rice grains from the normal and  
healthier grain. The perforation size of these cylinders is slightly less than the width  
of the normal rice. The under sized rice is dropped in the trough at the bottom and  
is carried away through the screw conveyor while normal sized rice retained in the  
cylinder is pushed by tilted rotation of the cylinder. 

16.15       Rice Whitening 

Partial  or  complete  removal  of  rice  bran  layer  is  carried  out  through  a  process  
referred as rice whitening or polishing. In industrial rice processing, polishing is  
considered as an essential segment of rice milling. The outer layer of rice comprises  
of aleuron layers which do not allow the rice to expand during cooking. In most  

----------------------- Page 433-----------------------

432                                                                                      M. Riaz et al. 

parts of the word, polished rice is consumed for its better cooking properties, ease  
in digestibility, better volume expansion ratio, and good aesthetic value. The bran  
layers  from  rice  are  removed  by  abrasion  or  frictional  force  (Wimberly  1983).  
Various types of rice whiteners are used for rice milling. 

Single machine mills         Single machine mills are primarily used for small scale milled  
rice production owing to their low milling capacity and greater susceptibility to dam- 
age rice grains. Single machine mill is powered by electric motors and in some regions  
via tractors, generators, or diesel engines. The machine comprises of steel or iron  
made rotating cylinder covered with a perforated steel sheet, a motor to derive steel  
cylinder, and a hopper. The paddy is fed from hopper to the space between rotating  
cylinder  by  rotational  direction  of  the  flutes  and  perforated  steel  cover.  Husk  and  
upper bran layer is removed and converted into powder-like small pieces by the fric- 
tional force, and pushed out of the huller through the perforations of the outer cover- 
ing. Some husk and bran part are included in whitened rice, which is further removed  
by sieving. Single machine mill can also separate broken kernels up to a desired level  
by sieving. Irrespective of its simplicity to handle paddy, steel-based single milling   
machine causes huge losses to the rice grains in the form of breakage. The modern  
single mills having rubber rolls for improved husking and steel whiteners are available  
now-a-days,  which  have  higher  raw  material  handling  capacity  with  lower  energy  
requirement and reduced breakage risks (Singhagajen and Thongsawang  1982). 

Multiple machine mills           Large capacity multiple machine mills are used at a com- 
mercial scale. These mills comprise of a machine for each process like cleaning,  
dehusking,  destoning,  paddy  separation,  whitening,  polishing,  color  sorting,  and  
other necessary processing operations. They have varying milling capacities start- 
ing from 1 to 10 or even more tons per hour. If the machines are installed at multiple  
floors  then  conveyor  or  bucket  elevators  are  used  to  transfer  the  product  of  one  
machine as raw material to the other machine. If machines are installed on the same  
floor then the difference between them is fixed in such a way that there should be no  
resistance in the flow of the rice grains through the pipes to a machine. This machine  
has higher milling capacity and operates more efficiently than single steel machine. 

Vertical abrasive whitener           Vertical abrasive whitener consists of a cone made of  
steel or stone directed by an electric motor from top or bottom. The cone is covered  
with a perforated screen housed in a frame and fixed to a strong base. The screen is  
divided  into  segments  by  adjustable  30–50  mm  rubber  brakes  at  regular  intervals  
around the cone. These brakes extend the full length of the cone with 2–3 mm clearance  
from the cone. The hulled rice is fed from top through a hopper and is moved to the  
clearance zone between screen and cone. The abrasive surface of the revolving cone  
removes the bran layer of the hulled rice. The bran powder is pushed through screens  
and is collected separately while white rice is collected at the bottom. The degree of  
milling is directly linked with the milling and cooking quality of rice. Lesser the clear- 
ance zone, the higher will be the degree of milling, keeping other factors including  
revolutions per minute of cone and feed rate as constant. Intended increase in degree of  
milling, however, may increase the breakage percentage. It is therefore advisable that  

----------------------- Page 434-----------------------

16   Harvesting, Threshing, Processing, and Products of Rice                             433 

complete bran removal should be avoided and hulled rice should be passed through  
multiple whiteners to reduce loss in the form of breakage. Any vibration in the cone  
may cause a great loss due to uneven polishing and increases breakage. It is therefore  
suggested that the whitening machines should be fixed on very solid and compact base.  
Damage to the rice grains during milling may be due to very high heat of resistance that  
may  develop  cracks  in  rice  and  increase  the  breakage  percentage  (Banaszek  and  
Siebenmorgen  1990). In order to avoid frequent losses from rice, air is continuously  
passed through the whiteners to remove heat of resistance and dust fraction. 

Horizontal abrasive whitener         The abrasive roll in horizontal abrasive whitener  
consists of an emery stone attached to a steel shaft rotated by an electric motor, and  
is covered with a metallic perforated cylindrical screen. The unhulled rice fed from  
one side travels along abrasive roll and bran is removed through abrasive action and  
is passed through the perforated sheet. The degree of milling is adjusted by the feed  
rate controlled at the intake hopper and pressure developed on account of adjustable  
weighted discharge gate. Breakage is increased if the feed rate is very low or the  
discharge rate is very high or very low. Breakage percentage has been controlled in  
horizontal abrasive whiteners by replacing the compact steel shaft with a hollow  
shaft having many small openings to dissipate heat developed in abrasion. Air is  
passed  through  these  openings  to  rice  and  escapes  through  perforated  screens.  
Multiple advantages have been gained through this mechanism including heat con- 
trol, removal of dust and powder, low breakage, and low perforation clogging risks.  
The disadvantage of this machine is that clearance between the screen and emery is  
not adjustable which is overcome by adjustable weighted discharge gate. Horizontal  
abrasive whiteners are more beneficial in parboiled rice milling where higher risks  
of screens clogging exist due to sticky and thick bran powder of parboiled rice. 

Horizontal friction whitener       The horizontal friction whiteners consist of a steel  
roller with a steel perforated sheet covering housed in casing. A feeding worm is  
used to force the grains in the clearance zone between the roll and the screen. Bran  
layer is removed by frictional force instead of abrasive action and is pushed out  
through perforations with the air entered through very small openings of the revolv- 
ing roll in the center. The pressure on the rice during whitening is controlled by a  
weight  adjustment  valve  at  the  outlet  spout.  Milling  capacity  and  recovery  is  
 compromised when single pass horizontal frictional whitener is used. It is better to  
use multistage frictional whiteners to get maximum recovery and minimize break- 
age percentage. Power requirement of horizontal whitener is about the same as that  
for vertical and horizontal abrasive polishers. 

16.16       Rice Polishing 

Rice polishing is the mechanism of making rice glossy or shiny. Physical appear- 
ance of rice depends on the degree of milling and polishing. Polishing of rice is  
characterized as single polished, double polished, touch silky, and silky polished.  

----------------------- Page 435-----------------------

434                                                                                M. Riaz et al. 

Single and double polished rice is prepared on abrasive or friction whiteners dis- 
cussed above, while polishers are used for silky or touch silky rice. 
    Polisher consists of a steel roller having very small holes mounted on a shaft that  
is connected to an electric motor. The roller is encompassed in perforated screens and  
the whole assembly is housed in a steel or iron casing. If the roller is covered with  
leather, then it is called as leather polisher. The leather gives a smooth surface and  
shine to the rice when grains pass through the clearance area between roller and  
screens. The leather strips roll the whitened rice over and over against the screen. The  
pressure on rice in the clearance area is controlled by the weight adjustment at the  
outlet cover. The uniform removal of the bran layers from the rice surface makes it  
shiner,  brighter,  and  glossy.  However,  negative  attributes  like  risks  of  off  flavors  
development and aflatoxins contamination during rest period make polishers as less  
adoptable technique for rice polishing. Due to this reason the leather polishers have  
been  replaced  with  water  polisher  around  the  globe. Water  polishers,  like  leather  
polishers, have a steel roller or drum connected to a shaft operated by an electric  
motor, water control system, and weight adjustment at outlet. The roller is encom- 
passed in a perforated sieve and the entire assembly is housed in a steel cylinder. Rice  
is fed into the clearance zone between rotating roller and sieve. Air passed through  
the roller to the clearance area escapes through the perforated sheets along with the  
fine powder of rice removed from rice surface during polishing. Air is used to dissi- 
pate heat from milling system to avoid heat-associated quality losses in rice. A fine  
mist of clean water is continuously sprayed on the rotor surface to make the rice  
surface glossy and shiny. This also helps to lower down the temperature of milled  
rice. Water polishers are very useful and widely used due to their high efficiency, less  
breakage, and production of high quality rice. Degree of polishing is directly depen- 
dent upon the retention time of rice in the clearance area, number of revolutions per  
minute of the rotor, quantity of the water sprayed, and feed rate (Satake  1990). 

16.17       Rice Grading 

Milling and polishing under abrasive and frictional forces may produce breakage of  
various sizes including broken, brews, germs, bran, and head rice. Separation of  
these particles after polishing or whitening is called grading. The degree of grading  
is dependent on the choice of the consumers or the rice market. Many markets do  
not  require  grading,  while  others  demand  a  sophisticated  grading  system  to  be  
implemented  in  order  to  improve  product  quality. The  demand  of  graded  rice  is  
directly linked with the economic condition of the consumers. A large part of the  
bran is removed from the screens of the whiteners or polishers and collected sepa- 
rately. However, remaining bran is removed by the process of aspiration for which  
the blowers are installed at length graders and before final packing. The mixture of  
broken, brews, germs, and head rice is sent to the plane or rotary sifter. The rotary  
sifter comprises of a set of two to three screens installed one above the other and  
fixed in a frame. Screens of various mesh size are installed starting from lower to  
higher mesh size from top to bottom. The head rice is separated by the top screen,  

----------------------- Page 436-----------------------

16   Harvesting, Threshing, Processing, and Products of Rice                             435 

while the fine tips are separated by the bottom screen. Similarly, broken grains of  
various sizes are separated by central screens (Kour and Singh 2013). In large indus- 
tries, two to eight sets of these screens are installed one above the other to increase  
the  efficiency  and  production  of  more  sophisticated  product.  The  vibratory  and  
oscillatory  movements  of  the  screens  do  not  efficiently  separate  broken  having  
length longer than the width of the rice. Hence, this head rice containing broken is  
passed through the length graders, which have already been explained above. 

16.18       Color Sorting 

The head rice may have pecky, damaged, yellow, green, chalky, amber, or red- colored  
grains. The presence of these various colored or damaged grains in export grade rice  
is considered to be a quality mark in international trade. It is, therefore, recommended  
to remove these contaminants before the rice is sent to the market. Before 1980s, it  
was considered very difficult to remove these grains from the head rice. The rice used  
to pass on a conveyor belt in front of the workers who had to manually pick these  
grains from the final marketable rice. However, now color sorters of various capacities  
are available and widely used around the globe for sorting rice (Lisin et al. 2011). 
   A color sorter consists of a hopper for intake of rice connected with chutes in an  
inclined position. Each chute is further divided into four channels. Rate of feed is  
controlled by a feeder device installed at the top of the chutes. The rice in thin layers  
falls  through  the  channels  by  gravitational  force.  Colored  grains  while  passing  
through the reflector panel are assessed by a high-resolution charge couple device  
(CCD) optical camera. A sensor connected with the camera passes a signal to the jet  
valve or ejector to push the undesired grain by a blow of air. The disqualified grains  
are  separated,  while  qualified  grains  are  collected  in  the  packaging  material  or  
stored temporarily in the final storage vessel. 
   Color sorters of various capacities and efficiencies are available in the market.  
These have revolutionized the rice export industry since its invention in the second  
last decade of the twentieth century. It has reduced substantial labor involvement for  
color sorting. The installation cost of the machine is too high and requires a huge  
capital but operational cost compromises its purchase. One of the biggest disadvan- 
tages of the machine is that qualified grains are also rejected along with the disquali- 
fied grains. However, color sorters advantages are beyond its disadvantages, as the  
rejected  grains  may  be  recovered  by  a  second  pass  through  the  machine.  The  
machine also requires a skillful person for its proper functioning and maintenance. 

16.19       Parboiling 

The word “parboiling” refers to partially boiled. Parboiling of rice means par- 
tial boiling of rice in the form of paddy. Parboiling is a hydrothermal technique  
for the treatment of rough rice (paddy) before drying and milling (Miah et al.  

----------------------- Page 437-----------------------

436                                                                                      M. Riaz et al. 

2002). Generally, rough rice is soaked in hot water or steamed before drying  
and milling. Since how long the process of parboiling exists, nobody knows;  
however, this process was recognized in the early nineteenth century to cope  
with beri beri and vitamin B  (thiamine) deficiency (Heinemann et al. 2005). A 1 
group of researchers observed a direct linkage of beri beri with the consump- 
tion of raw milled rice, and parboiled rice was reported to be a remedial tech- 
nique in beri beri. 

16.20        Parboiled Rice Has Many Advantages  
            and Disadvantages as Follows Over Raw Milled Rice 

16.20.1        Advantages  

Milling recovery of parboiled paddy is better compared to raw. During parboiling  
the starch is partially gelatinized, becomes stiff, harder, and fishers or cracks in rice  
are filled thus milling recovery and head rice yield is increased (Nguyen and Kunze  
1984). 

 1.  The rice texture is improved and it becomes more translucent during milling. 
 2.  Postharvest  losses  are  reduced  on  account  of  inactivation  of  enzymes  during  
    boiling or steaming. 
 3.  Hull can be removed very easily compared to raw rice milling. 
 4.  Expansion in volume mass ratio, hence less amount is required per serving. 
 5.  Better cooking quality due to reduction in breakage, bursting, or curling during  
    cooking. 
 6.  Nutritional quality is improved due to the transportation and fixation of vitamins  
    from bran layer to the starchy portion. 
 7.  Inferior rice varieties come at par with superiors. 
 8.  Simplicity of the process. 

16.20.2        Disadvantages  

 1.  The risk of development of off flavors in parboiled grains due to fermentation,  
    particularly in cold water. 
 2.  Rice  turns  light  yellow  to  black  depending  on  the  duration  of  soaking  or  
    steaming. 
 3.  Removal of bran layer is difficult and requires higher electric power; hence cost  
    of milling is higher compared to raw rice milling. 
 4.  It requires high initial capital for installation of a parboiling plant. 
 5.  Parboiled rice cannot be used in starch or brewing industry.

16.21       Parboiling Process 

In addition to all other steps taken for rice milling, paddy is soaked in water until mois- 
ture content reaches to 30 %. Heat treatment is applied to the paddy particularly by  
steam for the development of some important physicochemical changes followed by  
drying. Initial investment on paddy drying and rewetting can be saved by using fresh  
paddy just after threshing and cleaning for parboiling. Usually, the rice crop is harvested  
when the grain moisture contents are higher than 20 %; hence, high moisture contents  
will require less energy and time to gain desired moisture level, i.e., ~30 %. Paddy grains  
are passed through following steps for the manufacturing of parboiled rice. 

16.21.1       Soaking 

Freshly harvested, matured paddy grains are soaked in warm water to get water to  
be absorbed until 30 % moisture content. Water absorption by paddy depends upon  
the time of soaking, temperature, mineral contents, and pH of water. Cold water is  
absorbed very slowly by the paddy and hence higher soaking time is required for  
getting desired moisture level that may initiate fermentation. Prolonged fermenta- 
tion may also lead to the growth of molds and development of aflatoxins on paddy.  
It has been estimated that soaking is completed in just 2–4 h at a temperature of  
60–65 °C compared to 36–48 h in a water having temperature of 30 °C. Similarly,  
higher salt contents, minerals, and pH of water will slow down absorption of water  
in  paddy.  Soaking  under  vacuum  has  been  reported  to  reduce  soaking  time  and  
avoid problems like fermentation (Bello et al. 2008). 

16.21.2       Steaming 

Gelatinization of rice starch is one of the major objectives of parboiling that makes  
the rice grains harder and stiffer compared to the raw rice grains thus causing less  
breakage, improved milling recovery, fixation of biomolecules like vitamins, miner- 
als, etc., and improvement in organoleptic properties of rice. Steaming of soaked  
paddy is one of the improved methods available in the recent era for gelatinization  
of rice. The condensed moisture contents of steam have higher capability to increase  
the moisture contents of paddy up to 38  %. Starch at this high temperature and  
moisture is gelatinized (Sareepuang et al. 2008). This method has many advantages  
over primitive sun drying or dry heat: 

  1.  Steam has higher capacity to carry excessive heat. 
  2.  It carries moisture and increases the rate of condensation. 
  3.  It has the capacity to increase the moisture contents of soaked paddy.

  4.  It improves the gelatinizing properties of starch. 
  5.  It  helps  to  minimize  losses  like  burning  or  blackening  of  paddy  grains  as  a  
      result of dry heat. 
  6.  It helps to evaporate extra moisture from paddy leaving concentrated molecules  
      in the grain. 
  7.  The excessive heat of steam helps to kill the microorganisms particularly patho- 
      gens and to some extent degradation of toxins. 
  8.  Heating of soaked paddy with steam under pressure will help to open the husk  
      indicating  the  completion  of  the  process  consequently  the  dehulling  of  the  
      paddy will be easier. 
  9.  Steaming retains better color and flavor of rice compared to dry heat. 
 10.  It improves the cooking quality of rice, including separation of grains, volume  
      expansion, and decreased chances of bursting, curling, and breakage. 

    A range of utensils, structures, and equipment have been used for soaking and  
steaming of paddy on pilot plant and commercial units. 

16.21.3         Concrete Soaking Tanks 

Fixed structures with all four walls and floor made of bricks, mortar, and/or cement  
having no roof is used for soaking of paddy in hot or cold water. The size of the tank  
is made according to the requirement and may be rectangular or square. A typical  
soaking tank 2.4 m wide, 3 m long, and 2.1 m deep is considered to be suitable for  
pilot plants. Paddy is filled up to 1.7 m depth in order to accommodate swelling dur- 
ing  soaking.  Concrete  soaking  tank  has  less  initial  cost;  however,  it  has  many  
disadvantages. 

 1.  The tank cannot be inverted and paddy is removed from the tank manually and  
    labor faces problems in handling hot paddy. 
 2.  Cleaning of the concrete soaking tank is difficult and extra water and labor are  
    required for the purpose. 
 3.  Cracks may be developed in the concrete walls due to intensive use of water;  
    hence, continuous maintenance is required. 
 4.  Greater chances of microbial, pest, and rodent attack; hence, a higher contamina- 
    tion rate. 
 5.  Being open roof, its working depends upon environmental conditions. 
 6.  More heat loss if soaking is in hot water. 

16.21.4        Drying of Steamed Paddy  

Handling  of  steamed  paddy  is  more  sensitive  compared  to  rough  rice.  Steamed  
paddy is dried by the same methods as discussed for rough rice paddy with the  
exceptions that it requires higher initial temperature. Moreover, if the paddy is dried  

----------------------- Page 440-----------------------

16   Harvesting, Threshing, Processing, and Products of Rice                              439 

in a single stage, chances of cracks and fishers in the grain are increased; hence less  
recovery  with  more  breakage  and  poor  cooking  quality  has  been  observed  
(Siebenmorgen and Meullenet 2004). It is advisable to dry the steamed paddy in two  
to three stages on mechanical dryers and tempering duration of 12–36 h for each  
stage. The tempering time facilitates aging and equalizes the moisture content uni- 
formly among the paddy grains. 

16.22       Postharvest Losses 

Postharvest losses of cereal grains account for 10–40 % losses in grains quantity  
and/or quality from farm to fork. Developing countries are particularly more sus- 
ceptible to these losses on account of poor access to innovative harvesting, storage,  
transportation, drying, and milling techniques. Being a major field crop, postharvest  
losses of rice cannot be avoided but can be curtailed to an appreciable extent. Paddy,  
like other crops respires and hence loss of energy in the form of heat dissipated to  
the storage environment results in excessive loss of grain quality if not properly  
managed (Tyler and Gilman 1979). Sizeable reduction in postharvest losses reduces  
the cost of rice harvesting, drying, and milling. It helps to cut down the prices on  
trade distribution, improves the livelihood of the farmer and increases the purchas- 
ing power of the consumer as well (Panhwar 2006). Losses in rice can be curtailed  
by the application of advanced postharvest techniques in entire rice production and  
processing  chain.  Following  parameters  are  helpful  to  cut  down  the  postharvest  
losses to their minimum. 

  1.  Identification of maturity stage: Harvesting at maturity is necessary to avoid  
     losses from shattering and in the form of immature, slender, or chalky grains.  
     Over maturity leads to shattering of the grains in the field, while under ripening  
     results in slender and chalky grains. 
  2.  Rapid harvesting : The use of combine harvesting is helpful to manage the crop  
     very rapidly. The losses due to rains, thunder storms, attack of fungus and pests,  
     and inclusion of mud, dirt, and dust can be avoided. The combine harvesting  
     should therefore be preferred over conventional methods of harvesting of rice  
     crop. 
  3.  Timely threshing: The crop after harvesting should be threshed very rapidly.  
     Keeping crop untreated after harvesting increases the chances of fungus attack,  
     discoloration, yellowing, and shattering. 
  4.  Quick drying: Quick drying after harvesting and threshing reduces the chances  
     of heat burn during fresh crop storage. 
  5.  Mechanical drying—preferred drying technique: Mechanical drying compared  
     to  sun  drying  is  helpful  to  manage  the  crop  produce  rapidly.  It  reduces  the  
     chances of inclusion of dockage, fungal, and pests attack. Wise mechanical dry- 
     ing avoids the development of cracks and fissures, hence curtailing the milling  
     and quality losses.

  6.  Adequate  cleaning :  Cleaning  of  paddy  before  drying  and  milling  can  avoid  
     losses induced in the form of wear and tear of machines. It also improves the  
     milling recovery. It is, therefore, advisable to use precleaners before drying and  
     milling. 
  7.  Advanced rice milling : Advanced methods of rice milling can reduce the grain  
     losses to an appreciable extent. It has been estimated that head rice recovery at  
     village level husking-cum-milling machines is around 40 %, while it is 70–80 %  
     at advanced milling machines. It is, therefore, recommended to use pneumatic  
     huskers and rice polishers to avoid conventional methods of milling. 
  8.  Milling moisture : Proper moisture contents of paddy grains before milling is  
     vital to avoid excessive losses. The moisture content between 13 and 14 % is  
     considered ideal for maximum recovery of head rice. 
  9.  Storage: Storage of rice at 12 % moisture decreases the chances of mold attack.  
     Moreover, losses due to heat of evaporation are minimized if the paddy crop is  
     stored below 16 % moisture content. Proper aeration, control of pests, manage- 
     ment of relative humidity, and temperature are the key factors to avoid losses  
     during storage. 
 10.  Insects, pest management : Storage losses due to insects can be reduced by the  
     application  of  spray  of  piperonyl  butoxide,  tetrachlorovinfos,  fenithrothion,  
     etc., or a suitable fumigant like methyl bromide, phosgene, carbon tetrachlo- 
     ride, hydrogen cyanide, etc., after fixed intervals. 
 11.  Packaging and transportation: Poor transportation and defective packaging can  
     lead  to  quantitative  losses  of  the  product  (Kiaya  2014).  It  is,  therefore,  
      recommended to use packaging bags of various sizes and proper transportation  
     vehicles to avoid losses during traveling and storage. 

16.23       Rice Storage 

Paddy, if not immediately milled, is dried for storage. Likewise, milled rice needs to  
be stored until it is delivered to the market for sale. Paddy and rice can be stored for  
a few years if storage conditions are appropriate. Grain moisture is one of the impor- 
tant factors to be considered critically while planning for short term or long term  
storage. Higher the moisture of the commodity during storage, lesser will be the  
storage stability. It has been estimated that at 12 % moisture contents and optimum  
relative humidity, paddy, and rice can be stored for years (FAO 2008). Digital por- 
table and desktop grain moisture meters are available in local markets with a knob  
to put into heap or bag of rice or paddy grains. However, digital moisture meters are  
necessary to be calibrated with hot air ovens; a most reliable method for the deter- 
mination  of  moisture  in  any  commodity.  Insect  infestation  during  paddy  or  rice  
storage is a major concern that can be controlled by implementing an integrated pest  
management  program.  Need-based  storage  facilities  can  be  constructed  to  store  
paddy and rice at industrial and home scale levels. Generally, at home scale levels,  
paddy and rice are stored in bins made of mud, cement, and bamboo, or cement and  
bricks, or iron and steel. However, extended facilities in the form of temperature and

atmosphere controlled large silos and or warehouses with stacked sacks and bags of  
commodity are deployed at the industrial scale. 

16.24       Nutritional Composition and Significance of Rice  
           in Human Health 

Globally, rice stands third in a list of 30 highly produced and consumed food crops  
of the world with an estimated production of ~479 million metric tons of milled  
rice  (IGC.int  2015).  In Asian  perspectives,  rice  is  a  staple  diet  of  15  countries  
where the crop provides around 715 kcal per capita daily. On energy and nutrient  
scale, this much amount of rice consumption adds up ~27 % dietary energy and  
20 % daily protein intake. It is likely that in countries like Bangladesh, Viet Nam,  
Laos, Cambodia, and Myanmar rice consumption is responsible for 50 % per cap- 
ita dietary energy and protein requirements (FAOSTAT 2011). Before marketing,  
rice grains are milled to produce brown rice, white rice, hull, and bran nutritional  
composition of which varies with cultivars and milling extent. Despite the valuable  
nutrition of brown rice, globally higher intake is recorded for white polished rice.  
The milling and or polishing process destroys at least 50–90 % of rice B vitamins,  
essential minerals, fatty acids, and fiber (Ensminger and Ensminger  1986). 

16.25       Nutritional Composition of Rice 

Milled rice is referred to be a good source of carbohydrates, predominately starch,  
whereas appreciable amounts of macro and micronutrients that exists in bran fraction  
are leached down with mill-fractions. B vitamins are concentrated to a greater extent  
in bran layer and 65 % of thiamine, 39 % of riboflavin, and 54 % of niacin contents  
are reported in the same. It is due to these reasons that brown rice is recommended  
for consumption as edible grain as compared to milled rice that is devoid of pericarp,  
testa, embryo, and aleurone layer. Distribution of energy yielding compounds, i.e.,  
carbohydrates, protein, and fats varies with different rice fraction. Maximum protein  
(7.1–8.3 %) and fat (1.6–2.8 %) contents are anticipated in the brown rice, whereas  
maximum carbohydrates (77–89 %) are attributed to the milled rice. As far as some  
fractions are concerned, maximum protein, fat, and fiber contents are found in rice  
bran, i.e., 11.3–14.9 %, 15.0–19.7 %, and 7.0–11.4 %, respectively (Julino  1993). 

16.26       Micronutrient and Phenolics Contents 

Micro and macroelemental composition of rice varies with its various forms and  
processing conditions, e.g., those of parboiled, milled, and brown rice. The studies  
show higher ash contents (~18 %) in parboiled rice as compared to the milled rice  

----------------------- Page 443-----------------------

442                                                                                  M. Riaz et al. 

proclaiming higher contents of K and P (Heinemann et al. 2005). Nutritional assays  
on various cultivars reveal more or less similar as proximate composition including  
moisture, protein, fat, ash, and fiber; however, some minor differences exist for the  
micronutrients  particularly  vitamin  E,  thiamine,  and  iron. These  exist  in  higher  
amounts  in  Chinese  wild  rice  compared  to  the American  wild  rice  (Zhai  et  al.  
2001). Well-versed genetic diversity exists in rice as far as nutritional composition  
is concerned. A study carried out on unpolished rice reveals an intravarietal differ- 
ence in proteins (9 g), zinc (3.34 mg), thiamine (1.6 mg), iron (5.65 mg), niacin  
(7.2 mg), and riboflavin (0.39 mg) (Kennedy and Luo 2015). A recent update on  
nutritional quality of commercial rice available in Malaysia proclaims nondetect- 
able levels of cholesterol and very low level of trans fatty acid. The study estimates  
appreciable levels of vitamin B1, A, C, and E to exist in all commercial rice brands  
(Fairulnizal et al. 2015). Higher acceptability levels have been recorded for black  
rice in Korean culture where rice is consumed as staple food. Black rice is a good  
carrier  of  anthocyanin  and  associated  antioxidant  activity  and  hence  have  very  
important role of not only providing dietary energy but also functional health fea- 
tures to its ultimate consumers. Forty-two pigmented rice cultivars were analyzed  
for their micronutrient contents and radical scavenging activity. The study identi- 
fies iron to be the most prevalent mineral element as compared to Zn, Cu, and Mn.  
Antioxidant activity associated with their good pool of polyphenols was reported  
to be of 31.9–98.5 %, whereas tocotrienol contents were comparatively higher than  
tocopherol (Ha and Lee 2015). 

16.27        Rice Nutrition and Consumer’s Health 

Rice is not a primary food crop among most of the children and adolescents of  
America. Whereas, high and low rice consumers of non-Hispanic and Indo-Asian  
mixed racial children and the adolescents are reported to meet maximum of their  
caloric requirements from rice and hence have significantly higher body reserves  
of certain micronutrients, e.g., iron, folates, copper, magnesium, vitamin B6, vita- 
min C, thiamine, and niacin (Luo and Kennedy  2015). A significant difference  
exists in dietary pattern and energy intake of rice and non rice consumers that  
can be evaluated in the form of saturated fat consumption. Rice consumers are  
generally  referred  to  be  good  in  micronutrient  pool,  low  in  saturated  fats,  and  
physically  possess  lower  waist  circumference,  skinfold,  and  body  mass  index,  
                           2 
i.e., less than 25 kg/m  (Kennedy and Luo 2015). Higher household expenditure  
on rice in countries where it is cultivated as staple food crop is highly associated  
with multiple micronutrient deficiencies due to poor diet diversification and low  
expenditure on non rice foods. Torlesse et al. (2003) suggested reduction in the  
underweight children population of rice grown regions might be anticipated by  
more expenditure on non rice foods.

16.28        Recent Innovative Approaches to Improve Nutritional  
            Quality of Rice 

A  very  significant  role  of  nutritional  genomics  has  been  observed  to  cope  with  the  
 situation  of  multiple  micronutrient  deficiencies  in  health  and  economic  status  of  
 malnourished populations. Staple crops including wheat, rice, and maize that are not  
adequate or good source of vital nutrient like iron, vitamin A, iodine, and zinc were engi- 
neered owing to their maximum acceptability as staple food grains by the undernourished  
populations. In order to address ever increasing burden of anemic population from socio- 
economically weaker communities, transgenic iron fortified rice has been introduced that  
has been developed by adopting approaches like improving grain iron reserves, enhanc- 
ing iron translocation, and improving its flux into the endosperm (Masuda et al. 2012).  
The study referred further endorses multiple transgenic technologies to be the more effec- 
tive approach in addressing micronutrient deficiencies compared to single gene manipu- 
lation for some particular micronutrient. Genetically engineered rice cultivar ‘Golden  
Rice’ was produced aimed at addressing vitamin A deficiency and associated disorders.  
Genetic modifications were made to produce  β-carotene—pro-vitamin A in the endo- 
sperm, i.e., ~31 μg/g of 37 μg/g carotenoids. Despite more than normal reserves of vita- 
min A as carotenoids, a debate still exists on golden rice incompetency to address severe  
deficiencies of vitamin A in underprivileged populations (Dawe et al. 2002; Paine et al.  
2005). Zinc biofortification of rice is in practice by its foliar spray irrespective of environ- 
mental conditions, cultivars, and crop management practices. The biofortified rice crop is  
reported  to  significantly  affect  zinc  deficiencies  and  cut  down  burden  of  immune  
 dysfunction, growth retardation, and cognitive losses (Bashir et al. 2013). 

16.29        Rice Based Edible Products 

Cooked rice is taken as a staple diet by more than 50 % of world population. The  
major  by-products  during  milling  are  rice  bran,  husk,  brews,  germ,  and  polish.  
These by-products are primarily used in the feed industry. In addition, following  
food products are manufactured for human use. 

16.29.1        Rice Pudding  

Rice pudding is usually prepared by addition of water or milk in the rice along with  
other desired flavoring agents. Rice pudding makes delicious desserts for dinners  
equally liked by people of all ages in different cultures. Rice puddings being pre- 
pared as dessert are made with added sugar alongside cinnamon, ginger, flavor, and

444                                                                                       M. Riaz et al. 

egg. Variants of rice puddings are reported from various parts of the world depend- 
ing on regional food habits and cultures. Rice puddings being consumed as desserts  
in South Asian countries like India and Pakistan are known as Kheer and Firni. 
    Rice puddings are considered instant energizers as they contain high contents of  
carbohydrates as rice starch and simpler sugar. The presence of milk in rice pud- 
dings makes them rich in calcium and vitamin D that are beneficial for stronger  
bones and healthy teeth. Moreover, the fibers in the rice pudding help in regulation  
of bowel movement and relieve constipation. Rice puddings are also well known for  
their usage in human experimental studies related to bowel movements and blood  
glucose levels along with other ingredients (Hlebowicz et al. 2009; Pritchard et al.  
2015). Rice pudding does not contain gluten, so people allergic to gluten may rely  
on rice puddings for their energy requirements in addition to other gluten free diets.  
Depending upon the type of ingredients used, a serving of 5–6 ounces may provide  
130–230 kcal energy (Corleone 2015). 

16.29.2        Rice Bread  

Rice flour is used in some regions replacing wheat flour for the preparation of rice  
bread. Rice bread being gluten free is suitable for individuals allergic to gluten. For  
the preparation of gluten free breads, the rice flour may also be used in various propor- 
tions with other gluten free starch sources that include corn and potato for better vol- 
ume and crumb structure (Sanchez and Osella 2002). Rice flour supplementation has  
shown better sensory performance in gluten free bread preparation compared to corn  
and cassava flours (López et al. 2004). Rice flour is considered to be highly suitable  
for production of gluten free breads as it is colorless, easily digestible and hypoaller- 
genic with no off flavors. Other basic ingredients required for the production of rice  
bread include yeast, sugar, oil, water, and salt (Kadan et al. 2001). Rice flour is also  
low in sodium, fat, and fiber (Gujral and Rosell 2004a, b). Kadan at al. (2001) showed  
stronger tendencies of rice starch to retrogradation compared to whole wheat bread.  
However, due to lack of elasticity and plastic properties in rice proteins like those  
attributed to wheat gluten, application of rice flour in baking is limited (Juliano 1985).  
Gluten replacers such as hydroxy propyl methyl cellulose are used in addition to the  
basic ingredients to enhance the rheological properties of bread dough to obtain the  
bread with better crumb and textural properties (Sivaramakrishnan et al. 2004). 

16.29.3        Rice Cakes  

A rice cake is made from the rice, shaped, condensed, or combined into a single  
object. Rice cakes are becoming popular as a snack food among people because of  
their low caloric value and low fat contents. Rice cakes may be made from rice flour,  
ground rice, or from whole grain rice compressed or combined together with some  
binding  substance.  The  preparation  of  rice  cakes  is  based  upon  their  popping  

----------------------- Page 446-----------------------

16   Harvesting, Threshing, Processing, and Products of Rice                                         445 

characteristic under heat and pressure. The balance between the ingredients, mois- 
ture, time, and temperature is of foremost importance as their imbalance can result  
in the breakage of rice cakes during production decreasing their value. 
    Rice cakes prepared from rice grains are prepared in popping machines in which  
they are exposed to heat and high pressures. The rice should be subjected to ideal  
temperature and time combinations for its desired expansion. The additives such as  
flavors and sweeteners are sprayed onto the cakes after their preparation as early  
addition of additives increases the risk of cake breakage. Sticky rice varieties are  
preferred, while the long grain varieties do not expand much during cooking. 
    Stabilizers and to some extent emulsifiers are used in rice cake preparation to  
improve viscosity and stability of batter. A study showed that the addition of xan- 
than and xanthan-guar gum blends showed increased viscosity of the batter. The  
addition of emulsifier blend resulted in softer and porous final product (Turabi et al.  
2008).  However,  the  baking  methods  also  affect  the  microstructures  of  cake.  
Conventional baking methods tend to deform the starch structure more as compared  
to  the  cakes  baked  through  combination  of  IR-MW  (infrared-microwave)  ovens  
(Turabi et al. 2010). 

16.29.4        Rice Noodles  

Rice noodles are prepared using rice flour and water. Noodles from rice flour are  
very popular traditional foods in the South China. The production processes used  
for a particular type may differ from region to region to meet local demand; how- 
ever, the basic production principles are usually the same. Rice noodles are classi- 
fied on the basis of molding methods as well as the moisture contents. On the basis  
of molding method, rice noodles are classified into cutting noodles (1 mm thick,  
4–6 mm wide, and 200 mm long) and spreading noodles (rice noodle wrapper rolls  
containing different fillings) (Li et al. 2015). 
    On the basis of moisture contents, rice noodles are further classified as dehy- 
drated  and  fresh  noodles.  The  amount  of  moisture  in  fresh  rice  noodles  ranges  
between 40 and 65 %, while that of dehydrated noodles ranges between 15 and  
25 %. Moisture content plays an important role in flavor and texture of the noodles.  
However, higher moisture contents compromise shelf-life of the finished product.  
On the contrary, dehydration can improve shelf-life of the rice noodles for extended  
period of time (Chen et al. 2012). 

16.29.5        Rice Bran Oil  

Rice bran oil (RBO) is extracted from the hard outer brown layer well known as  
bran of the rice. Crude form of rice bran oil is obtained using solvent extraction fol- 
lowed by distillation. RBO is considered to be very useful for salads and cooking

(Ghosh 2007). The smoke point of RBO is up to 213 °C and its saponification value  
ranges between 180 and 195 (Orthoefer 2005). 
    In its crude form, RBO comprises of 2–4 % free fatty acids (FFA) that can initi- 
ate lipids hydrolysis if FFA are not extracted immediately. The FFA develops at a  
rapid pace of ~5–7 % per day in the rice bran. Therefore, it is important to stabilize  
the rice bran before extraction to obtain good quality rice bran oil (Saunders  1985). 
    During recent years, RBO has gained significant popularity on account of its  
health benefits. RBO and its essential fatty acids composition have shown an ability  
to improve plasma protein patterns of rodents, rabbits, and humans through reduc- 
tion of plasma cholesterol and concentration of triglycerides along with an increase  
in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels (Cicero and Gaddi 2001). A study revealed  
that   RBO   exhibits   cholesterol   lowering   ability   in   healthy   and   moderately  
 hypercholesterolemic  adults,  decreasing  LDL  concentration  ~7  %.  This  activity  
may be attributed to unsaponifiable components of RBO (Most et al. 2005). Other  
beneficial  effects  of  RBO  include  anti-inflammatory  properties  (Nagasaka  et  al.  
2007). Other than consumption, researchers have been working on the utilization of  
RBO as biodiesel fuel through transesterification for the production of RBO methyl  
(Sinha et al. 2008). 

16.29.6         Rice Vinegar  

Rice vinegar has been in use with the Chinese people for almost 3000 years. Rice  
vinegar is made by fermenting rice into alcohol and then further into acid. Sometimes  
rice vinegar may be confused with rice wine. However, they both are different prod- 
ucts. Rice wine is prepared through a fermentation process that involves yeast for  
the transformation of sugars from rice into alcohol. While for the preparation of rice  
vinegar, another step is required that involves the addition of bacteria for the conver- 
sion of alcohol into acid (Xu et al. 2010). Rice vinegar is sodium free making it  
beneficial for hypertension patients (Corleone 2015). 

16.29.7         Edible Rice Films and Wrappers  

Rice flour is usually prepared from broken rice that is not fit for further processing.  
Therefore, in many cases it proves to be cheaper than other sources of starch. Use of  
rice flour for the edible films and coatings is becoming popular. Different methods  
are being developed to reduce its levels of permeability. A study revealed that the  
rice flour or rice starch coating with sorbitol as a plasticizing agent decreased the  
permeability of water and resulted in more rigid structure (Dias et al. 2010). Rice  
protein concentrate was also used to prepare edible films with addition of polysac- 
charides complex (pullulan) along with the incorporation of oils for enhanced resis- 
tance against water vapors (Shih 1996). In another study, rice wax up to 46.4 % was

used in addition to pullulan to obtain compact film structures. Addition of rice wax  
is also reported to improve moisture barrier properties (Shih et al. 2011). 

16.29.8         Other Products 

Other products of rice that are accepted by a large number of consumers include rice  
cereals, rice fudge, rice cookies, and crackers. Some of the products like rice milk  
are not very common among the people but are in use due to certain health compli- 
cations in particular individuals. Most of the rice products are used as an alternative  
due to shortage of other available raw material or by the individuals having certain  
disorders related to consumption of some food stuff. 

16.30        Rice Quality 

Rice quality is a difficult term to define as it depends upon the acceptability of the  
consumer to a greater extent. However, on broader term, rice quality may be divided  
into two categories, i.e., milling and cooking. Milling quality of rice determines the  
final yield during milling, while cooking quality determines the acceptability of the  
consumer. Both cooking and milling quality of rice depend upon the type of the  
variety, environmental factors involved during production and methods of harvest- 
ing, drying, and milling of rice (Siebenmorgen and Meullenet 2004). 

16.30.1        Milling Quality  

Paddy having high head rice yield, low broken, bran, and polish is considered good  
for  milling.  Milling  quality  of  paddy  is  dependent  on  the  following  interrelated  
factors: 

Moisture content         Moisture contents at harvesting and subsequent storage before  
or after drying of paddy are one of the most important factors contributing toward  
the storage, milling, and cooking quality of rice. The optimum temperature at har- 
vesting may reduce the losses due to shattering on account of less moisture contents  
and unripened paddy grains due to high moisture contents. The ideal moisture con- 
tents for harvesting are 20–26 %. Maximum milling yield of rice can be obtained at  
13–14 % moisture contents of paddy. The broken percentage below and above this  
optimum  moisture  contents  may  increase  due  to  pulverization  and  stiffness  of  
grains. Control of moisture contents during drying is also a critical factor to ensure  
the milling and cooking quality of rice, as cracks and fissures are the characteristics  
attributed toward improper paddy drying. 

----------------------- Page 449-----------------------

448                                                                              M. Riaz et al. 

Degree of purity      Purity is related to the presence of dockage, i.e., materials other  
than paddy including hay, chaff, stones, seeds of weeds, soil, and mud, etc., included  
from the field or drying floor. Impurities increase the cost of paddy cleaning or some  
time  wear  and  tear  of  the  machines.  Milling  yield  is  also  influenced  by  these  
impurities. 

Admixture      Seeds of contrasting varieties may be mixed during handling at farm or  
may be added as adulterant during paddy drying. Grains of various sizes and shapes  
make  it  difficult  to  adjust  hullers,  huskers,  whiteners,  and  polishers  to  produce  
whole  grains;  hence  head  rice  yield  is  reduced.  In  addition  to  milling  recovery,  
cooking quality of rice and hence consumer’s acceptability is influenced. 

Cracked grains       Exposure of paddy grains with shocks of high temperature and  
moisture may result in the development of cracks and fissures in the rice. These fis- 
sured and cracked grains cannot withstand high pressure of frictional forces of mill- 
ing. Hence, broken percentage is increased with low head rice yield. 

Immature grains       Immature grains that have not developed properly are thinner,  
slender, chalky, and opaque on milling. The higher the percentage of these grains in  
the paddy, the lower will be the milling recovery. After milling, these are converted  
into broken, brew, and polish and ultimately reduce the head rice yield. 

Damaged grains        High moisture, insect attack, and high temperature during stor- 
age may cause physical and biochemical changes in the grains. The grains have less  
tensile strength and cannot withstand milling resulting in increased broken percent- 
age and reduced milling yield. 

Discolored grains     The grains of various colors including yellow, amber, chalky, red,  
and green may be present in the paddy that might come from the field due to environ- 
mental factors or high moisture during temporary storage before drying. Various bio- 
chemical reactions and microbiological activity may generate excessive heat during  
temporary storage of the paddy and partly gelatinize the rice starch, hence changing  
the color of rice from white to amber, yellow, brown, or black. This discoloration may  
not influence the milling yield but influences the consumer acceptance. 

16.30.2        Cooking Quality 

Cooking quality of rice in addition to above factors is also dependent on the follow- 
ing factors: 

Variety of rice    Variety is one of the major factors of rice contributing toward its  
cooking quality. Starch is 90 % of the dry matter content of rice. It is composed of  
linear (amylose) and branched (amylopectin) polymers of glucose units. The amy- 

----------------------- Page 450-----------------------

16   Harvesting, Threshing, Processing, and Products of Rice                               449 

lose has the lesser tendency to hold moisture. Rice having high amylose contents  
dries at cooking, absorbs less water, and becomes hard upon cooling (Bhattacharya  
2011). On the other hand varieties having higher contents of amylopectin absorb  
more water, become sticky, and do not become dry on cooling. Rice having amylose  
content 1–2 %, 3–9 %, 10–20 %, 21–25 %, 26–30 % is considered as waxy, very  
low, low, intermediate, and high amylose content rice, respectively. 

Degree of milling     Degree of milling is the measure of percentage of bran removed  
from the brown rice. It is the degree of milling that determines the color of the rice,  
milling  yield,  broken  percentage,  absorption  of  water,  volume  expansion  of  rice  
grain  during  cooking,  and  consumer’s  acceptance  (Champagne  2004).  The  bran  
layer on the surface of brown rice allows poor absorption of water hence does not  
allow starch to expand properly. Moreover, complete removal of bran layer again  
causes excessive absorption of water and its seepage in rice starch from the grains,  
hence causing stickiness of rice. Proper degree of milling is compulsory for the rice  
having  good  cooking  and  consumer’s  acceptance  qualities.  It  is  considered  that  
75 % bran removal may result in rice of good cooking qualities (Rodriguez-Arzuaga  
et al. 2014). 

Gel consistency     It measures the tendency of cooked rice to harden on cooling. Rice  
varieties  having  softer  touch  on  cooling  within  the  same  amylose  contents  have  
higher degree of tenderness, and are preferred around the globe. Rice varieties hav- 
ing higher amylose contents are harder. Gel consistency is measured by heating rice  
in small quantity of dilute alkali (Bergman et al. 2004). 

Gelatinization temperature         The time required for cooking milled rice is called  
gelatinization temperature. The gelatinization temperature is influenced by environ- 
mental factors particularly temperature during rice production. Higher the tempera- 
ture  during  rice  production,  greater  is  the  gelatinization  temperature  of  the  rice  
(Waters et al. 2006; Shu et al. 2006). 

16.31       Conclusions 

Mechanical methods of drying, improved versions of hullers, and advancement  
in the milling machinery have resulted in high yield and better cooking quality of  
rice.  In  addition,  better  storage  techniques  and  advancement  in  the  means  of  
transportation curtailed the postharvest losses to certain extent. However, socio- 
economic limitations, lack of awareness, and poverty are the major hurdles to  
adopt   innovative   techniques   and   machinery   in   the   developing   countries.  
Research-based  strategies  to  develop  cost-effective  techniques  for  harvesting,  
drying, storage, hulling, and milling of rice are further required, particularly for  
small farmers of the developing economies to curtail postharvest losses and to  
impart better quality to rice.

17.1       Introduction 

Rice  (Oryza  sativa  L.)  is  the  staple  food  for  millions  across  the  globe.  Major  
 consumption of rice takes place in the tropical and subtropical Asia. Globally, rice  
is grown either as upland and/or lowland crop. Although, the irrigated lowland rice  
covers about 57 % of the land under rice cultivation but that contributes nearly 76 %  
of the global rice production (Papademetriou 2000). 
    The rice growth cycle can be divided into three distinct growth stages, viz., (i)  
germination and stand establishment, (ii) vegetative stage, and (iii) reproductive and  
grain-filling/grain ripening stage (Fig.  17.1; Fageria et al. 2006). Rice plant enters  
from one phase to the other one after a specific period of time (Tables  17.1 and  
17.2).  Tillering,  root  growth,  stem  growth,  and  leaf  development  are  the  major  
events of vegetative growth phase. Booting, heading, flowering, and panicle devel- 
opment (panicle size and spikelets per panicle) are the main events of reproductive  
growth phase. During grain-/spikelet-filling stage, the grain weight/spikelet weight  
is  determined  (Fageria  et  al.  2006).  In  this  chapter,  the  physiology  of  different  
growth stages, aerenchyma formation, and stomatal development of rice is  discussed.

17.2.1        Germination and Stand Establishment 

Seed germination is a crucial stage in rice life cycle which starts from the water  
uptake by dry seeds and ends with radicle protrusion (Bewley  1997). For nutrient  
storage, rice seed has dominant endosperm enriched with starch. The endosperm is

surrounded by an embryo and aleurone layer. Scutellum, a metamorphous of coty- 
ledon, lies between the endosperm and embryo. The endosperm and embryo have  
differential  role  in  seed  germination  in  rice.  Most  of  the  genetic  information  is  
encoded within the embryo. Seed germination takes place in three phases in rice  
(Yang et al. 2007). In the first phase, rapid uptake of water occurs which initiates the  
mRNA synthesis (Howell et al. 2009). Upon imbibition of water in the phase I, the  
embryo produces various types of phytohormones [mainly gibberellic acid (GA)],  
which initiates a signaling cascade after diffusing through the aleurone layer and  
leads toward the synthesis of hydrolytic enzymes (α-amylase being the most impor- 
tant). These enzymes are secreted in the  endosperm, which initiates the hydrolysis  
of food reserves for further development of rice seedlings (Jacobsen et al.  1995;  
Bethke et al.  1997). Phase II is vital for metabolism reactivation, reserve mobiliza- 
tion, repair of cell structure, loosening of cell wall, and elongation of coleoptile.  
During the phase III, rapid water uptake induces the aerobic respiration, initiates  
cell division, and pushes the radicle protrusion – initiation of the seedling establish- 
ment (Yang et al. 2007). This is followed by emergence of prophyll from the cole- 
optile. Following this, the first complete leaf emerges. The seedling development  
continuous and follows the order as (i) leaf initiation, (ii) leaf elongation, (iii) leaf  
blade maturation, (iv) collar formation, (v) leaf sheath elongation, (vi) node forma- 
tion,  and  (vii)  internode  elongation  (Counce  et  al.  2000).  Internode  elongation  
occurs for the final five internodes of the rice main stem. 
    Various external and internal factors such as light, water, temperature, level of  
phytohormones, and circadian rhythm regulate the rice seed germination (Penfield  
et al. 2005; Holdsworth et al. 2008). Among these factors, water status is the most  
important; its deficiency may affect the seed germination (Hundertmark et al. 2011).  
Rice seed can also germinate under anaerobic conditions via rapid coleoptile elon- 
gation (Menegus et al. 1991; Perata et al. 1997), and the radicle continues to  elongate  
when switched toward aerobic conditions. This suggests that availability of oxygen

is another factor controlling the true germination of rice seed (Howell et al. 2009).  
Temperature has a strong impact on germination of rice seed. The imbibition in rice  
seeds occurs at an adequate temperature in the presence of oxygen (Yoshida 1981).  
The minimum, optimum, and maximum temperatures for rice seed germination are  
6, 37, and 41 °C, respectively, while the minimum, optimum, and maximum tem- 
peratures for seedling development are 8, 37, and 44 °C, respectively (Chaudhary  
and Ghildyal 1969; Alocilja and Ritchic 1991). 

17.2.2       Vegetative Stage 

17.2.2.1     Tillering and Shoot/Root Growth 

Tiller initiation in rice starts when rice seedlings are at 3–4 leaf stages. Tillers are  
the secondary shoots which appear on the main shoot. The formation of tillers is  
completed over a period of 2–3 weeks. In rice, tillering proceeds without any restric- 
tion when the plant nitrogen contents are ≥3.5 % in the presence of sufficient light  
energy (Murata and Matsushima  1975). Phosphorus (P) concentration in the rice  
stem below than 0.25 % may restrict the tillering (Counce et al. 2003). For tiller  
emergence, optimum water temperature during the day is 31 °C while that for night  
is 16 °C. Water temperature above 31 °C affects the tiller emergence. The tillering  
continues if the light reaches the base of the rice plant (Counce et al. 2003). 
   Some tillers may die during the rice growth cycle, and surplus amount of nutri- 
ents  in  dying  tillers  may  be  translocated  to  other  healthy  tillers  (Murata  and  
Matsushima 1975). Li et al. (2003) isolated and characterized a gene MONOCULM  
1 (MOC1), which controls tillering in rice. This MOC1 gene encodes reputed GRAS  
nuclear protein families, which are expressed in axillary buds, thus initiating the  
formation of axillary buds and facilitates their outgrowth. 
   Various hormones are involved in tillering, e.g., cytokinins (CK), auxins, and  
strigolactones (SL) which play the key role (Kebrom and Richards 2013). Auxins  
suppress the outgrowth of the axillary bud. These auxins are produced in young  
developing  leaves  and  are  transported  actively  but  basipetally  through  the  shoot  
(Agusti  and  Greb  2013),  and  this  is  termed  as  polar  auxin  transport  (PAT).  
Zazímalová et al. (2010) reported that PAT relies on the PIN-FORMED (PIN) pro- 
tein families and auxin efflux carriers of ATP-binding cassette B (ABCB). The aux- 
ins travel through the outermost shoot apex epidermal layer and reach to plant organ  
initiation sites. From here, auxins move toward the basipetal stream of the main  
shoot via the developing primordia. The PIN1 proteins, which are present in paren- 
chyma cells of xylem, sustain the supplementation of auxin toward the basipetal  
stream  of  main  shoot,  thus  playing  key  role  in  PAT  (Petrásek  and  Friml  2009).  
Underexpression  of  OsPIN1b  (previously  known  as  REH1)  enhances  tillering  in  
rice  (Table  17.3;  Xu  et  al.  2005;  Chen  et  al.  2012).  Overexpression  of  OsPIN2  
enhances tillering but reduces the stature (Chen et al. 2012). Some members of the  
miR393 miRNA family also impact tillering in rice by regulating the expression of

both the auxin receptors (OsTIR1 and OsAFB2), successively repressing the expres- 
sion of OsAUX1 (auxin transporter) (Xia et al. 2012). This results in the downregu- 
lation  of  OsTB1  (a  tillering  repressor),  thus  explaining  the  improved  tillering  in  
OsmiR393  overexpressing  plants.  Zhang  et  al.  (2009)  reported  another  auxin-  
dependent pathway involving an indole-3-acetic acid (IAA)-amido synthetase (i.e.,  
TLD1)  which  conjugates  with  amino  acids  to  convert  active  form  of  auxin  into  
inactive, thus regulating tillering in rice. 
    The root system of rice is comprised of crown roots, lateral roots, and seminal  
roots which corresponds to root-borne, stem-borne, and pole-borne roots, respec- 
tively. Like other monocots, the rice is characterized with fibrous root system pos- 
sessing many crown roots. The rice plant grown under field conditions may have  
several hundred crown roots (Kawata et al.  1978; Kawashima 1988). The expres- 
sion of QHB gene takes place in central cells of quiescent center within the apical  
meristem  of  root,  while  the  expression  of  OsSCR  gene  takes  place  in  the  root

 endodermis (Table 17.3; Kamiya et al. 2003a, b). The crown root primordium dur- 
ing crown root development initiates from the innermost cells of ground meristem,  
neighboring the peripheral cylinder of stem vascular bundles. These cells progres- 
sively differentiate into several tissues, e.g., epidermis, cortex, endodermis, root  
cap, and stele (central cylinder), in succession to form a full organization of the  
apical meristem of the crown root. When the preclinical division of endodermal  
cells forms the cortex, the expression of the OsSCR becomes downregulated within  
the cells of daughter cortex (Kamiya et al. 2003a). At the next stage, regulated cell  
division in each tissue enhances total cell number. Further, two periclinal divisions  
of  the  innermost  cell  of  ground  meristem  form  few  layers  of  initial  crown  root  
 primordium  cells.  These  initial  crown  root  primordium  cells  and  their  nuclei  
become enlarged, and a gradual increase in their protoplasm density takes place.  
Later on, inner cell layers of the initial crown root primordium divide periclinally  
and  anticlinally  to  form  a  central  cylinder  initial  and  an  epidermis–endodermis  
initial. After that, the outer layer cells of the initial crown root primordium begin to  
divide anticlinally to give rise to root cap initial. Specific cell layer divides peri- 
clinally, and epidermis–endodermis initial is separated into epidermis and endo- 
dermis, while root cap and central cylinder initials undergo anticlinal and periclinal  
divisions to enhance their own size. The endodermal cells undergo various asym- 
metrical periclinal divisions to form different layers of cortical cells (Kawata and  
Lai  1965). Periclinal divisions in cells of root cap initial result in the formation of  
columella. At this stage, a big metaxylem vessel is visible in center of stele. The  
central  cylinder  initial  cells   (stelar  initial)  become  dome-shaped  after  periclinal  
and anticlinal divisions. During the same time course, cells constituting various  
vascular bundle tissues are progressively differentiated. Later on, all tissue cells  
turn out to be elongated and vacuolated simultaneously, and the crown root emerges  
from the stem in the basal region of the primordium. Cells in cortex show vacuola- 
tion, while those that are in the basal region of the stele show vacuolation as well  
as elongation (Kawata and Harada 1975). 
   Abscisic acid (ABA) and auxin promote while cytokinin suppresses the lateral  
development  of  roots.  Ethylene  also  plays  a  role  in  lateral  root  development  by  
interacting with auxin through cortical cell breakdown. Gibberellic acid promotes  
the growth of adventitious roots in flooded rice in combination with ethylene. High  
concentration of zeatin in root exudates favors the stronger root activity within rice  
hybrids, thus proposing that the cytokinin contents in roots could be considered as  
an important trait of root physiology. In another study, the use of an antisense trans- 
genic predicted that cytokinins play a crucial role in rice root development (Liu  
et al. 2003). Besides improving the lateral development of roots, ABA promotes the  
root hair formation, tip swelling, and root water permeability in rice (Chen et al.  
2006). Ethylene mediates the formation of aerenchyma and growth of adventitious  
roots in flooded rice (Rzewuski and Sauter 2008). Auxins modulate the gravitrop- 
ism and the nodal and seminal root growth (Nakamura et al. 2006). 
   Cytokinins  (CKs),  the  key  regulators  of  several  developmental  processes  of  
plants  (Mok  1994),  are  synthesized  within  roots  and  are  transported  in  upward  
direction with plants along the xylem (Wang and Li 2006). In the transgenic rice,

overexpression of the isopentenyl transferase (OsIPTs) enhances the axillary bud  
activity and minimizes the root formation activity, and these are typical of CK over- 
expression.  Until  now,  eight  OsIPT  genes  are  identified  in  the  rice  genome  
(Sakamoto et al. 2006). GAs also have strong influence on several developmental  
processes, especially the root and stem development (Lo et al. 2008). 

17.2.2.2     Leaf Development 

Rice  produces  ≥  ten  leaves  prior  to  initiation  of  reproductive  phase  (Itoh  et  al.  
2005). The leaf development events occur in the following order for each rice node:  
(i) leaf initiation, (ii) leaf elongation, (iii) leaf blade maturation, (iv) collar forma- 
tion, (v) leaf sheath elongation, (vi) node formation, and (vii) internode elongation.  
The intermodal elongation takes place for only five internodes of the main rice stem  
(Counce et al. 2003). The leaves are formed continuously. Cell division/expansion,  
tissue  differentiation,  axis  determination,  and  tissue  specification  are  the  main  
events taking place during the leaf development (Itoh et al. 2005). The mature leaf  
of rice is strap-like, which can be easily distinguished into three regions along the  
proximal–distal axis. Leaf blade is distal region and is the major photosynthetic site.  
Leaf sheath is the proximal region and thus encloses the shoot apex while protecting  
the younger from physical damage. The boundary of the leaf sheath and leaf blade  
is comprised of three distinct parts, viz., ligule, auricle, and the lamina joint (collar)  
(Itoh et al. 2005). The ligule is acuminate and membranous, which is usually divided  
into two segments within the mature leaves. The collar or lamina joint is a whitish  
region within the leaf blade base which assists leaf blade to bend toward the abaxial  
side. The auricles (two in number) are the small appendages having long hairs and  
are situated at the margins of rice leaves (Itoh et al. 2005). 
   Rice leaves are polarized along the adaxial–abaxial axis. Several papilla and two  
different kinds of trichrome are present over the entire surface of leaf excluding the  
leaf  sheath  adaxial  surface.  Bulliform  cells,  organized  in  vertical  rows,  stuck  
between vascular bundles in the leaf blade adaxial epidermis. Both small and large  
types of vascular bundles are present in leaves (Itoh et al.  2005). The xylem and  
phloem are located at the adaxial and abaxial sides of vascular bundles, respectively.  
These vascular bundles are enclosed by bundle sheath cells. The leaf blade vascular  
bundles on adaxial/abaxial side possess the sclerenchymatous fiber cells. The leaf  
sheath and leaf blade margins vary in shape, the margin of the leaf sheath being  
pointed and membranous (Itoh et al. 2005). 
   Leaf primordium looks like a small bulge present at the edge of shoot apical  
meristem. It grows toward opposite side of the shoot apical meristem and toward  
apex and after protrusion; it forms a crescent-shaped primordium. Cell division in  
leaf primordium is several times more than that take place in shoot apical meristem  
(SAM), as confirmed by histone H4 expression (Itoh et al. 2000). Leaf founder cell  
stage can be distinguished from leaf primordium stage through using several mark- 
ers. The expression of OsSCR is initiated in the epidermal layer of the leaf primor- 
dium which gradually becomes specific to several epidermis files (Kamiya et al.  

----------------------- Page 464-----------------------

464                                                                   A. Nawaz and M. Farooq 

2003a). The DROOPING LEAF (DL) gene, which is a regulator of carpel specifica- 
tion and formation of midrib, is firstly expressed within leaf primordium central  
region (Table  17.3; Yamaguchi et al. 2004). 
   In  apical  and  marginal  regions,  rapid  cell  division/elongation  causes  the  leaf  
 primordium to become hood shaped, and the commencing of procambial strand can  
be seen at the center of leaf at this stage. Further, both leaf primordium margins  
overlap with each other and surround the shoot apical meristem (Itoh et al. 2005).  
At this stage, leaf primordium shape seems to be cone-like, and the boundary of  
blade  (lamina)–sheath  becomes  visible.  At  the  boundary  of  adaxial  surface  of  
blade–sheath,  a  protrusion  of  ligule  primordium  originates  from  epidermal  cells  
after  periclinal  divisions  (Itoh  et  al.  2005).  Progressively,  the  commencement  of  
different  plant  tissues  takes  place  at  this  stage.  Cell  file-specific  expression  of  
OsSCR  gene  within  epidermis  can  be  found  at  ligule  primordium  (Table  17.3;  
Kamiya et al. 2003a). The xylem/phloem is recognized in midvein, when the large  
vascular bundles surround the whole leaf width. On the other hand, the formation of  
small vascular bundles starts between large vascular bundles, and differentiation of  
macro hairs takes place at leaf-tip epidermis at this stage. At the distal region, the  
formation  of  stomata  proceeds  basipetally,  while  the  epidermis  proximal  region  
remains immature (Itoh et al. 2005). 
   After  ligule  primordium  differentiation,  the  leaf  blade  extends  very  fast  and  
attains its maximum length, but elongation of leaf sheath remains inhibited. This  
elongation of leaf blade is attributed to the enhanced activity of intercalary meri- 
stems which are housed in leaf blade basal region (Kaufman  1959). At this stage,  
the expression of genes (e.g.,  OsPNH1, OsSCR, and DL) associated with cell dif- 
ferentiation becomes downregulated (Table  17.3; Nishimura et al. 2002; Kamiya  
et al. 2003a; Yamaguchi et al. 2004). 
   The leaf sheath elongation becomes rapid after the completion of elongation of  
leaf blade. Epidermis-specific cells such as silica cells, bulliform cells, and stomata  
cells from apex become visible. At this time, sclerenchymatous cell differentiation  
occurs on the external side of vascular bundles. When leaf blade tip appears out of  
the  preceding  leaf  sheath,  the  leaf  epidermal  and  internal  structures  are  nearly  
 complete excluding those which are found in the proximal region. Special air spaces  
(the lacunas) are also formed in the inner tissue of midrib and leaf sheath, basipe- 
tally. Unequal elongation, in the adaxial and abaxial cells, forces the leaf blade to  
bend toward lamina joint (Maeda  1961). 

17.2.2.3     Aerenchyma Formation 

After flooding, within 24 h, the supply of oxygen (O ) becomes limited due to usage 2 
by soil bacteria (Ponnamperuma  1972). The rice roots require oxygen to stay alive  
and function properly. The roots become coated with ferrous iron in most of the  
flooded mineral soils. This iron is associated with sideraphores and the conversion  
of ferric form of iron to ferrous needs oxygen. The rice leaves may die within three  
to six phyllochrones of their elongation, so they cannot provide conduit for oxygen.  

----------------------- Page 465-----------------------

17   Rice Physiology                                                                   465 

The nodes and internodes persist and conduit oxygen from the above floodwater  
into the roots. Aerenchyma, the tissue capable to conduit oxygen, is developed from  
the orderly killing (programmed cell death) of several plant tissues to produce large  
intercellular spaces (Counce et al. 2003). Three decades back, Kawai et al. ( 1998)  
reported that acidification of cytoplasm and loss in the integrity of plasma mem- 
brane are the preceeders of cell death in rice, with the gas space spreading radially.  
The cell death in roots and coleoptiles is usually very rapid. Rupture of tonoplast is  
the first step in the initiation of aerenchyma cells, which is followed by swelling of  
cytoplasm, rupture of plasma membrane, degradation of walls, and damaging of  
cellular contents (Inada et al. 2002). Aerenchyma in rice are well developed in leaf  
sheath, internodes, roots, and in leaf midrib (Colmer and Pedersen 2008; Steffens  
et al.  2011), which facilitates inner aeration among the roots and shoots (Colmer  
and Pedersen 2008). Indeed, the submerged leaves have gas films, which facilitate  
the exchange of carbon dioxide (CO ) and O  between plant leaves and water, and 2 2 
thus enhance the underwater net photosynthesis by improving the uptake of O  for 2 
respiration during night and supplying CO  during the day (Raskin and Kende 1983; 2 
Pedersen et al.  2009). These leaf gas films thus help in sugar production within  
leaves by promoting photosynthesis when underwater and thus encourage the shoots  
and roots to work properly (Pedersen et al. 2009). 
   Aerenchyma formation is vital for the plants (e.g., rice) to survive and function  
in submerged conditions. Aerenchyma cells not only supply O  from shoots to roots 2 
but also help in ventilation of various gases such as methane and CO  from soil to 2 
the  aerial  environment  (Colmer  2003;  Evans  2003).  This  ventilation  is  mainly  
caused by diffusion of gases (Armstrong et al.  1996). In rice, the developed aeren- 
chyma cells are called lysigenous aerenchyma (Jackson et al.  1985), which may be  
developed in root cortex, pith cavity, and stem cortex (Armstrong  1979). 
   In rice, the formation of aerenchyma cells initiates at the root apical parts and  
then expands gradually to the basal parts (Ranathunge et al. 2003). Fully developed  
aerenchyma cells, present on basal parts of the roots, separate the outer cell layers  
from the inner root stele (Armstrong and Armstrong 1994; Ranathunge et al. 2003).  
The constituents of remaining cell walls and cells form the radial bridges thus dif- 
ferentiating the gas spaces present in cortex. These gas spaces play important role in  
maintaining  the  root  structural  integrity  and  nutrient  transport  (apoplastic  and  
assymplastic) (Drew and Fourcy  1986). During aerenchyma formation, cell death  
within the rice roots begins in the mid-cortex and then spreads toward the  neighboring  
cortical cells radially (Kawai et al.  1998). The epidermis, endodermis, stele, and  
exodermis remain unaffected (Yamauchi et al. 2011). 
   In roots, the lysigenous aerenchyma formation may be enhanced through ethyl- 
ene application under aerated conditions and can be suppressed with silver ions  
under stagnant (0.1 % agar) deoxygenated conditions (Wiengweera et al.  1997).  
Cell wall degradation takes place during aerenchyma formation, and this process is  
mediated by modification in the degradation of cell wall enzymes. Subsequently,  
the further degradation of cell will take place through various enzymatic actions,  
viz.,  xylanolytic,  pectolytic,  and  cellulosolytic  (Jackson  and  Armstrong  1999;  
Evans 2003).

    During,  lysigenous  aerenchyma  formation,  the  death  of  root  cell  cortex  takes  
place in five major steps (Joshi and Kumar 2012). Firstly, the perception of hypoxia  
and initiation of biosynthesis of ethylene takes place. Secondly, perception of ethyl- 
ene signaling takes place by mid-cortex cells. Thirdly, the ions are loosed to the  
neighboring environment, followed by invagination of plasma membrane, thus ini- 
tiating cell death and small vesicle formation. Fourthly, the condensation of chro- 
matin takes place which is followed by enhanced activity of hydrolytic enzymes of  
cell wall, and cell organelles are enclosed by membranes. At final step, the final  
degradation of cell wall takes place followed by cell lysis (Joshi and Kumar 2012).  
The surrounding cells absorb the cell contents and water. 

17.2.2.4       Stomatal Formation 

Stomata are microscopic aperture structures present on epidermis of plant leaves. In  
rice, the stomata are distributed on surface of leaf in vertical rows. The stomata pres- 
ent on the leaf sheath adaxial surface are rudimentary. In rice leaf epidermis, the  
distribution of cell rows of stomata is not random, and these cells are situated on  
vascular bundle boundaries. These rows are further differentiated into two different  
adjacent files (Itoh et al. 2005). In stomatal cell rows, uniform and specific expres- 
sion of  OsSCR gene is uniformly and specifically expressed in the stomatal cell  
rows (Table  17.3). The rice stomata have two narrow and thick-walled guard cells,  
having two subsidiary cells in neighborhood. During the formation of leaf ligule  
primordium, on leaf epidermis, the formation of stomatal cells occurs basipetally.  
Firstly, nonspecialized epidermal cells (NEC) and guard mother cells (GMCs) are  
formed through asymmetric divisions within the stomata cells. The NEC is large  
and weakly stained, while GMC is small, strongly stained cell (Itoh et al. 2005). In  
GMC, the expression of OsSCR gene is retained. In other cells of epidermis of sto- 
mata cell row, the expression of this gene is downregulated. At later stage, the polar- 
ized expression of this gene (i.e.,  OsSCR) can be observed on subsidiary mother  
cells (SMC) on GMC. The second asymmetric division takes place in the two lateral  
epidermal cells (subsidiary mother cells), adjacent to the GMC, to form subsidiary  
cells, which results in the formation of a three-cell complex (GMC + two subsidiary  
cells) (Itoh et al. 2005). The expression of  OsSCR takes place in GMC as well as  
two subsidiary cells. Final symmetric transverse divisions in GMC form a pair of  
guard cells. At this stage, expression of OsSCR becomes very low. The subsidiary  
cells become ellipsoidal, while the guard cells enlarge and become dumbbell shaped  
at maturity (Luo et al. 2012; Itoh et al. 2005). 

17.2.3       Reproductive Development  

The reproductive phase starts with panicle initiation during the development of inter- 
nodes (Leonards 2010). Initially, the panicles are microscopic in size wrapped within  
the stem. After the start of internode elongation, the buildup of chlorophyll takes

17   Rice Physiology                                                                        467 

place between the nodes. This chlorophyll imparts green color and forms green ring/ 
band, which surrounds the developing internode. As panicle and internode formation  
continues,  the  differentiation  of  panicle  is  started.  The  newly  forming  panicle  
becomes  visible  at  this  stage,  having  an  approximate  length  of  2  mm  (Leonards  
2010). The panicle growth and development continues inside the stem, and develop- 
mental stage is called booting. This stage can be classified further on the basis of  
panicle length. When panicle length is up to 2.5 cm, the growth stage is referred to as  
early boot. When the panicle length is 5–12 cm and  ≥12 cm, the growth stage is  
called as middle boot and late boot, respectively. The identification of the rice devel- 
opmental  stages  up  to  this  point  needs  the  dissection  of  the  stem  (split  in  half)  
(Leonards  2010).  The  development  of  panicle  is  completed  during  the  late  boot  
stage, and the panicle becomes visible outside the stem. The growth stage is referred  
as heading stage when panicle becomes visible from the flag leaf. The heading stage  
can also be classified further and is identified by percentages, e.g., the crop is said to  
be at 50 % heading stage when panicle is visible on 50 % rice stems (Leonards 2010). 
    The flowering and grain-filling stages start within 1–5 days after heading stage.  
The grain-filling stages can further be divided into milk stage (7–10 days after head- 
ing), dough stage, and physiological maturity stage. At milk stage, the white sub- 
stance starts to accumulate. One week after the start of milk stage, dough stage is  
initiated where milky stuff becomes the texture of bread dough. At physiological  
maturity stage, the grains achieve maximum dry matter accumulation and become  
firm. The crop cannot be harvested at this stage as the grain moisture contents are  
≥30 %. It may take two more weeks to drop the grain moisture contents to 20 %  
(harvest maturity), depending on weather conditions (Leonards 2010). Physiology  
of various reproductive and grain-filling processes has been discussed in the follow- 
ing lines. 

17.2.3.1     Spikelets 

After producing two sterile glume pairs (i.e., empty and rudimentary glumes), the  
floret meristem is formed from the spikelet meristem. The spikelets in rice consist  
of a single floret. Rice florets are consisted of palea, lemma, six stamens, two lodi- 
cules (known as petals), and one pistil. Only a single carpel constitutes this pistil.  
After  production  of  lateral  branches,  the  spikelet  meristem  is  formed  from  the  
branch/inflorescence meristems. Later on, two sterile glumes are formed from the  
spikelet  meristem  in  1/2  alternate  arrangement.  These  glumes  have  rudimentary  
shape with no axillary buds. In rice, two empty glumes are also formed in contrast  
to other grasses. The expression of FZP gene, vital for the formation of floret meri- 
stem, takes place at this stage (Table  17.3; Komatsu et al. 2003). Further, spikelet  
meristem forms floret meristem with two kinds of glumes (palea and lemma) and  
other floral organs. The palea and lemma identity is regulated by LHS genes (Jeon  
et al. 2000). Expression of RAP1 genes also occurs in lemma and palea primordium  
(Kyozuka et al. 2000). 
    The two empty glumes formed in rice are much smaller than lemma but larger  
than rudimentary glumes. The six glumes (two empty and two rudimentary glumes,

468                                                                 A. Nawaz and M. Farooq 

palea and lemma) are organized in 1/2 alternate phyllotaxy. Three floral organs, viz.,  
lodicules (two), stamens (six), and pistil (one), are shaped after the formation of palea  
(Itoh et al. 2005). The lodicules oriented at lemma side are whitish and smaller in size  
and are called petals. The expression of genes such as OsMADS45, OsMADS2, RAP1,  
and SPW1 takes place in lodicules (Kyozuka et al. 2000, Nagasawa et al. 2003). 
   All the stamens in rice are formed in a whorl. The expression of genes such as  
SPW1,  OsMADS45, and RAG takes place in stamens (Table  17.3; Kyozuka et al.  
2000, Nagasawa et al. 2003). From the lemma side of floral meristem, one carpel  
primordium is differentiated, which afterward encloses this floral meristem. At this  
stage, the stamen primordium is transformed into a filament and an anther (Itoh  
et al. 2005). The expression of genes such as RAG, OsMADS45, and DL takes place  
in carpel primordium (Kyozuka et al. 2000; Yamaguchi et al. 2004). 
   Sepals are lacking in rice flower as against the other monocot and dicot flowers.  
Interestingly, only two lodicules biased to the lemma side are present in rice, which  
suggests that one lodicule present on palea side has probably been lost in the past  
during evolution (Itoh et al. 2005). The identity of carpel in rice is principally regu- 
lated by the DL gene (Nagasawa et al. 2003). 

17.2.3.2     Megasporogenesis and Megagametogenesis 

Carpel primordium spreads toward palea side with the downregulation of  OSH1  
expression of floral meristem and thus is transformed into ovule primordium. The  
carpel encloses the ovule at this stage. Later on, female gamete is formed in the  
ovule,  followed  by  production  of  pollen  grains  within  anther.  In  the  ovule,  the  
OsMADS13  and  OsMADS45  genes  are  expressed  (Lopez-Dee  et  al.  1999).  The  
expression of MSP1 gene takes place in the surrounding tissues of female and male  
sporocytes  (Nonomura  et  al.  2003).  The  proximal  end  of  ovule  primordium  is  
attached to the palea-side carpel. 
   Later on, the formation of integument primordium occurs from ovule primordium  
base. The ovule is enclosed by carpel to form an ovary locule (Itoh et al.  2005).   
At this stage, AINTEGUMENTA gene expression starts in integument primordium. 
   The outer and inner integuments are formed from the single integument primor- 
dium. The expression of SUPERWOMAN1/OsMADS16 genes take place (Nagasawa  
et al.  2003) on abaxial side of the outer integument. The expression of multiple  
sporocyte1 (MSP1) gene takes place in the whole carpel and ovule (Nonomura et al.  
2003). The archesporial cell enlarges and is then distinguished into the megaspore  
mother cell (MMC). Although, the elongation is taking place in both inner as well  
as outer integuments, however, it is significant in the inner integument and encloses  
most of the nucleus excluding micropyle area near MMC (Itoh et al. 2005). After  
that, the ovule ascents toward receptacle side, and embryo sac (polygonum type) is  
formed in the nucleus. The meiotic division in MMC forms four different mega- 
spores, which are arranged linearly in direction of micropyle–chalaza. Just chalazal  
megaspore functions while other three degenerate (Itoh et al. 2005).

   Following  meiosis,  the  mitotic  nuclear  division  in  the  functional  megaspore  
forms two nucleate cells, which gradually degenerate, and the enlargement of mega- 
gametophyte occurs. Later on, this megagametophyte forms a large vacuole. Second  
mitotic division occurs in each of the two nuclei. Sequentially, third mitotic division  
in  megagametophyte  occurs  and  it  becomes  eight  nucleated  (Itoh  et  al.  2005).  
Cellularization occurs when each (out of eight) nuclei drifts toward its respective  
positions. Thus, the completion of the hemianatropous ovule occurs consisting of an  
embryo sac, which is composed of one egg cell, two synergids, one central cell  
(formed from the fusion of two polar nuclei), and antipodal cells (Itoh et al. 2005).  
In rice, the antipodal cells continue to divide at chalazal end by forming antipodal  
cell cluster (Huang and Sheridan  1994). 

17.2.3.3     Microsporogenesis and Microgametogenesis 

The anther initial is ovoidal and takes place in transverse section, which successively  
becomes four cornered in shape. In rice, the formation of stamens starts in the third  
flower whorl. The anther primordium is composed of three distinct layers, viz., L1,  
L2, and L3 (Satina et al.  1940; Goldberg et al. 1993). The L1 layer in rice anther pri- 
mordium forms the stomium and epidermis, which have vital role in the dehiscence  
of anthers. On the other hand, the L2 layer forms the primordial germ/archesporial  
cells from which the microsporangium and pollen are developed. The L3 layer forms  
vascular bundles, connective cells, and circular cell cluster, which are very near to the  
stomium  (Raghavan  1988;  Nonomura  et  al.  2003).  The  connective  cells,  present  
between vascular bundles and microsporangia, degenerate during gametogenesis. 
   The hypodermal anther cells are equipped with cylindrical rows, which can segre- 
gate into ACs. These ACs have slightly enlarged cytoplasm and nucleus, which distin- 
guish them from other cells. After differentiation, continuous cell divisions in these  
cells result in the formation of primary parietal cells (PPCs) and primary sporogenous  
cells. Repeated periclinal divisions in PPCs form endothecium, a tapetum layer, and a  
middle layer. Mitosis in PSCs forms the pollen mother cells (PMCs) (Itoh et al. 2005). 
   Anticlinal divisions cause the expansion of each four-walled layer. The tapetal  
cells, being binucleated, provide materials for pollen wall and also the nutrition to  
gametophytes (Scott et al. 2004), thus serving as a nurse tissue. With the completion  
of anther wall, the PMCs undergo the premeiotic synthesis of DNA and enter meio- 
sis (Nonomura et al. 2004b). In meiotic events, the spores are first developed into  
haploid gametophytes, which form gametes (haploid). When the free microspores  
are released from the tetrads, these become enlarged and spherical, but no mitotic  
cell division has been observed at this stage. In most of flowers, male gametophyte  
uninucleate status retains until heading. Although, the length of anther is highly cor- 
related with the development of microsporangia, the most of the anthers attain elon- 
gation when uninucleate stage is at the end. First mitosis inside the pollen forms two  
types of nucleus, viz., vegetative and generative. Subsequently, the generative cells  
are distinguished into two sperm cells.

17.2.3.4      Fertilization and Grain Development 

Grain development, in rice, starts with double fertilization. After the pollination, pol- 
len grain germinates to develop into pollen tube, which elongates to reach ovaries  
(Fig.  17.2; Farooq et al. 2014). The pollen grain growth requires the energy, which  
is provided by the acid invertase action in the developing pollen tube. Upon fertiliza- 
tion, the endosperm and the developing embryo need nutrients primarily provided by  
sucrose through assimilate transport in phloem. The cell expansion causes the cary- 
opsis to elongate to the maximum space of lemma and palea (the “hull” for rice). 
    After the elongation of caryopsis, the process of grain filling starts. There is no  
deposition of starch at the end of cell elongation. Most of the synthetic biochemistry  
takes place in two cell organelles, viz., plastid and cytosol. The route of carbon in the  
cytosol is from the imported sucrose. During grain filling, the sucrose is broken down  
into UDP-glucose and UDP-fructose by the action of sucrose synthase. The primary  
sucrolytic  enzyme  in  the  endosperm  of  rice  is  one  or  more  of  the  isoforms  of  the  
sucrose synthase (Avigad and Dey  1996). For rice, three sucrose synthase isogenes  
have been identified, which code for various enzymes taking part in different tissues  
and various development phases (Counce et al. 2003). In the next step, the  UDP-glucose

Fig. 17.2   Starch biosynthesis in the developing rice grain. Biosynthesis of starch, in rice, starts  
with the conversion of glucose-1-phosphate to glucosyl donor ADP-glucose (ADPG). The reaction  
is catalyzed by AGPase (ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase). Synthesis of of α-1,4 linkages during  
elongation of amylopectin is mediated by soluble starch synthase (SS). Starch-branching enzyme  
(BE) catalyzes the formation of α-1,6 linkages in glucose polymer creating the branched amylo- 
pectin. Starch debranching enzyme (DBE) isoamylase removes some of the  α-1,6 linkages and  
forms the crystalline shape of amylopectin. Filled circle indicates G-6-P transporter and open cir- 
cle is ADPG transporter (Modified from Farooq et al. (2014))

is converted into glucose-1-phosphate. The enzyme involved is UDP-glucose pyro- 
phosphorylase. The action of various enzymes may convert the fructose into glucose  
phosphates and progressively into starch. In the next step, the G-1-P is either converted  
into G-6-P via phosphoglucose isomerase or is transported into plastids. At this point,  
the synthesis of starch starts either in cytosol or in amyloplast via the ADP-glucose  
pyrophosphorylase. The production of starch in plastid is limited by AGP  (situated in  
cytosol) (Shannon et al. 1998; Farooq et al. 2014). ADP-glucose is the starting point of  
synthesis of starch and the further synthesis of starch takes place in the plastid. Once  
the starch synthesis has been started, the single glucosyl unit add to either straight or  
branched chains accomplished with starch synthase. Starch-branching enzyme is also  
involved in the branching of starch chains for further starch synthesis. Branching, resiz- 
ing, and debranching of the starch are important for progressive shaping, assembly,  
reassembly, and disassembly of the developing endosperm. The enzymes involved in  
these  events  are  starch- branching  enzyme,  starch  debranching  enzyme,  starch  syn- 
thase, and D-enzyme (Myers et al. 2000). These events form highly structured granules  
in which the starch is packed in alternating zones of less and more branched amylopec- 
tin (Myers et al. 2000). In rice and other cereals, the starch structure is highly variable  
and may fluctuate greatly with temperature regimes. The starch granules of rice are  
smaller than the other cereals. The most sensitive enzyme to temperature is starch syn- 
thase as compared to other starch synthesis enzymes (Keeling et al.  1994). During  
grain filling, high temperature may cause chalkiness owing to decrease in the activity  
of starch synthase (Chaudhary and Hara 1977). Potassium is also required by the starch  
synthase for the proper activity (Marschner 1995). Thus the first step in grain develop- 
ment is the formation of individual starch molecules. Later on, these starch molecules  
assemble to form the starch granules (Myers et al. 2000). 
   After the filling of endosperm cells with starch, the cells of aleurone layer are  
filled with protein and lipds. The sub-aleurone cells have lipid, protein, and starch.  
The starchy endosperm cells not only contain starch but a little amount (6–7 %) of  
protein (Juliano and Bechtel  1985). The genes involved in the grain filling in most  
of cereals are common and well documented (Counce et al. 2003). 

17.3      Resistance to Abiotic Stresses 

Productivity of rice is constrained by several biotic and abiotic stresses. Among the  
abiotic stresses, submergence, drought, salinity, and heat stress are more devastating.  
In the following lines, mechanism of resistance to above stresses in rice is discussed. 

17.3.1       Submergence 

Several key physiological traits help rice plant to perform well under submergence  
stress (Setter et al.  1997). These traits include the high carbohydrate concentration  
before  and  during  submergence,  increase  in  alcoholic  fermentation  rate,  and

conservation of energy by reduction in the elongation growth (Setter et al.  1997).  
During submergence, the capacity of plants to produce carbohydrates depends on  
several factors including the shading or dark treatments before/during submergence  
(Palada and Vergara  1972), time of day during submergence (Setter et al.  1997),  
carbon  dioxide  supply  and  pH  (floodwater)  which  impacts  the  underwater  plant  
photosynthesis (Setter et al.  1989), irradiance before plant submergence, seedling  
age, and seed size (Ella and Setter 1996). Increase in the rate of alcoholic fermenta- 
tion under submergence may be attributed to increase in the activity of alcoholic  
fermentation  enzymes,  dying  of  mutants  without  alcohol  dehydrogenase,  and  
increase in sugar (Waters et al.  1991). Thus resistance against submergence in rice  
is a complex physiological adaptation. A single putative gene encodes a trans-act- 
ing/transcription  factor  (i.e.,  RNA  or  a  protein)  (Ferl  1990;  Ricard  et  al.  1994),  
which either binds to unique regulatory sequences of DNA (Singer and Berg  1991)  
or impacts the pathway of transduction of signals (Dolferus et al. 1994). Submergence  
may  lead  toward  the  induction  of  more  than  ten  major  anaerobic  genes  in  rice  
(Rivoal et al.  1989; Setter et al. 1997). Furthermore, aerenchyma formation in rice  
facilitates the diffusion of oxygen from aerial to the submerged plant parts  (discussed  
above), thus helping for resistance against submergence. The resistance against sub- 
mergence in completely submerged rice is also linked to the presence of a gene  
Submergence1 (Sub1), which is located on chromosome 9 (Xu and Mackill  1996)  
in rice. FR13A Sub1 region encodes three different transcription factors (Sub1A,  
Sub1B, and Sub1C), which correspond to the B-2 subgroup of the ethylene response  
factors  (Xu  et  al.  2006). The  Sub1A/Sub1C  transcription  is  strongly  upregulated  
while that of Sub1B is slightly upregulated upon submergence, however, downregu- 
lated by de- submergence (Xu et al. 2006). 

17.3.2       Drought  

Drought stress is very detrimental to rice as it affects the morphological, physiologi- 
cal, and yield-related parameters of rice (Table 17.4). Several studies have identified  
the physiological basis of drought resistance in rice. For instance, Ji et al. (2012)  
reported that the activity of Rubisco activase, chloroplastic superoxide dismutase,  
peptidyl-prolyl  cis-trans  isomerase,  Cu-Zn,  and  dehydroascorbate  reductase  was  
upregulated under drought stress. Rabello et al. (2008) identified genes, which were  
related to maintenance of cell integrity and cell turgor during drought stress in rice.  
They also identified L-ascorbate peroxidase 1, superoxide dismutase [Cu-Zn], cyto- 
solic malate dehydrogenase, and ascorbate peroxidase as dominant protein confer- 
ring drought tolerance in rice. Rice plants possessing the water-channel protein, i.e.,  
RWC3, had better root hydraulic conductivity and leaf water potential (Lian et al.  
2004). Accumulation  of  proline,  polyamines  (spermidine  and  spermine),  soluble  
sugars, sucrose, glycinebetaine, and other solutes also help in improving resistance  
against drought (Pandey and Shukla 2015). Among these solutes, proline is of vital  
importance. Besides acting as an excellent osmolyte, proline also acts as a metal

chelator, a signaling molecule, and an antioxidative (Hayat et al.  2012) and thus  
imparts resistance against drought. Proline accumulation also enhances the antioxi- 
dant activities. Exogenous application of polyamines improved water relations, net  
photosynthesis, proline accumulation and anthocyanin and soluble phenolic accu- 
mulation  and  helped  alleviating  the  oxidative  damage  to  cellular  membranes  
(Farooq et al. 2009a). Moreover, improvement in the antioxidant defense system of  
plant  may  help  to  cope  drought  stress  in  rice  (Pandey  and  Shukla  2015).  With  
increasing levels of drought stress in rice, the activities of ascorbate, glutathione,  
ascorbate  peroxidase  (Selote  and  Khanna-Chopra  2004),  superoxide  dismutase,  
monodehydroascorbate reductase, dehydroascorbate reductase, glutathione reduc- 
tase (Sharma and Dubey 2005), phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, and catalase (Shehab  
et al. 2010) consistently increase which are very beneficial for drought resistance.  
Abscisic acid can help in inducing resistance against drought in rice by improving  
the status of antioxidant enzymes (Latif 2014; Li et al. 2014) and improving trans- 
port  of  proteins  and  carbon  metabolism  and  expression  of  stress  proteins  (Zhou  
et al.  2014). Overexpression of C  photosynthesis enzymes such as phosphoenol-4 
pyruvate carboxylase and pyruvate orthophosphate dikinase (Zhou et al. 2011; Gu  
et al. 2013) may also help rice plant to withstand with drought. 
    Drought stress in rice reduces grain size, grain weight (Venuprasad et al. 2011;  
Mostajeran and Rahimi-Eichi 2009), and seed-setting rate (Ji et al. 2012), increases  
the spikelet sterility (Kumar et al. 2014), and thus taxes the grain yield. This reduc- 
tion in grain yield may also be attributed to shortening of grain-filling period, dis- 
turbance  of  leaf  gas  exchange,  reducing  of  source  and  sink  size,  and  impaired  
loading of phloem and assimilate translocation (Farooq et al.  2009b, c), reduced  
CO   assimilation,  decreased  stomatal  conductance/photosynthetic  pigments,  and 2 
disturbed  and  reduced  activities  of  sucrose  and  other  starch  synthesis  enzymes  
(Farooq et al. 2009b, 2014). 

17.3.3       Salt Stress 

Salt stress strongly affects the productivity of rice (Table  17.4). Resistance against  
salt stress, in rice, may be attributed to various antioxidant enzymes such as peroxi- 
dases (Mittal and Dubey 1991; Wu et al. 2005). Wu et al. (2005) also identified four  
genes in rice conferring the resistance against salt stress. These genes include Asr1 ,  
LIP9, salT, and GRP. In rice, Kawasaki et al. (2001) also reported the induction of  
stress ribosomal proteins under salinity. Chen et al. (2007) also reported that resis- 
tance against salinity, in rice, may be improved by increasing expression level of a  
              +   + 
vacuolar Na /H  antiporter gene. Gong et al. (2006) reported that silicon deposition  
in the roots of rice may help in decreasing the sodium uptake by reducing bypass  
flow. In rice, OsHKT2 is rapidly downregulated to reduce the influx of potentially  
          + 
toxic Na  at higher external sodium concentrations. SKC1 gene, expressed in paren- 
                                                                                  +    + 
chyma cells, was related with salt resistance owing to its role in the K /Na  homeo- 
stasis under salt stress (Ren et al. 2005). In a recent study, rice cultivars with better

resistance against salt stress had higher catalase activity and accumulation of pro- 
line and hydrogen peroxide (Chunthaburee et al. 2016). In another study, Igarashi  
et al. ( 1997) reported that the accumulation of proline helped the plants to produce  
higher green leaf area under salt stress (Pongprayoon et al.  2008). Roychoudury  
et  al.  (2008)  further  documented  involvement  of  anthocyanin  production  in  salt  
resistance in rice. Indeed, anthocyanins under salt stress reduce the oxidative dam- 
age (Hughes et al. 2005) and function as antioxidants by detoxifying the reactive  
oxygen species (ROS) (Kytridis and Manetas 2006). 

17.3.4       Heat Stress  

Like drought, heat stress is also very detrimental to rice as it strongly affects the  
morphological,   physiological,   and   yield-related   traits   of   rice   (Table            17.4).  
Antioxidant  enzymes  play  important  role  in  thermotolerance  by  scavenging  the  
ROS and protect the membranes from oxidative damages (Ali et al. 2013). Ye et al.  
(2012)  identified  four  different  single-nucleotide  polymorphisms  in  rice,  which  
were associated with resistance against heat stress. They used selective genotyping  
as well as single marker analysis techniques to find these nucleotide polymorphs.  
They also found four putative QTL, which were linked with resistance against heat  
stress in rice F2 population. In another study, Cao et al. (2008) reported that resis- 
tance against heat stress in rice was attributed to strong antioxidative defense sys- 
tem, little ethylene synthesis, high RNA contents, and reduced malondialdehyde  
content during meiosis. 
    The expression of various protective proteins (HSP90, Cpn60, HSP70) and  
thiamine  biosynthesis  protein  (THI1)  was  enhanced  (Scafaro  et  al.  2010).  
Jagadish et al. (2010) also reported that accumulation of heat-shock protein in  
rice may confer resistance against heat stress. Another NAC gene, viz., SNAC3  
(ONAC003, LOC_Os01g09550), which is stress responsive, has been reported to  
confer resistance against heat and drought stresses in rice by quenching the ROS  
(Fang et al. 2015). 

17.4       Conclusions 

The growth cycle of rice can be divided into three distinct growth phases including  
germination/seedling, vegetative, reproductive, and grain development. The repro- 
ductive  phase,  in  particular  the  grain  development,  is  the  most  important  stage,  
which  dictates  its  yield  potential.  Floral  development,  gametogenesis,  and  grain  
development are regulated by expression of specific genes and homeostasis of plant  
hormones. Understanding the plant physiology may help to improve the yield for- 
mation and crop productivity. The differences within different species of rice for  
gene expression during the reproductive phases need to be investigated. Moreover,

the expression of these genes under various growth environments may be a topic of  
future scientific debates. 
    Rice may produce well in a variety of environments. However, several biotic and  
abiotic stresses impede its productivity. Among the abiotic stresses, submergence,  
drought,  salinity,  and  heat  stress  are  more  devastating.  Although  physiological  
mechanisms of resistance against abiotic stresses in rice are relatively well under- 
stood, further studies to determine the physiological basis of assimilate partitioning  
from source to sink; plant phenotypic flexibility, which leads to resistance against  
abiotic stresses; and factors that modulate stress response in rice are needed. The  
genomic  resources  combined  with  ecophysiological  research  may  be  helpful  to  
understand the genotypes and environment interactions and to develop rice geno- 
types better able to produce well under less than optimum conditions.

18.1       Introduction 

Rice  is  the  most  important  cereal  crop  and  a  firmly  established  model  plant  for  
 scientists. Recent advances in molecular biology and omics research have dramati- 
cally changed our capability for gene discovery and functional genomics of rice. A  
holistic  “snapshot”  of  a  rice  cell  can  be  obtained  with  transcript  and  metabolite  
profiling. With the recent advances in phenomics research, one can easily expose a  
germplasm to diverse field environments in a more integrative approach capturing  
whole- plant adaptation and trait diversity. Ultimately, the genetic control for spe- 
cific component traits can be investigated with a reductionist approach in controlled  
environments (Dingkuhn et al. 2015). With revolutionary progress in systems biol- 
ogy and molecular techniques, functions of cohorts of genes and their regulation are  
being predicted, validated, and implemented for improvement of rice cultivars. 
    Rice provides 31 % of all food energy consumed in Asia, 8 % in Africa, and 11 %  
in Latin America (ILSI International Food Biotechnology Committee 2008). Rice  
cultivation is a major socioeconomical and even political activity in many Asian

countries.  More  than  50  %  of  the  population  of  China,  Thailand,  and  Vietnam  
directly or indirectly depend on rice for their food and livelihood. 
   Demand for rice continues to increase due to the ever increasing rice consumer base.  
However, the present rate of increase in rice production (2000–2009) has slowed down  
(1.21 %) when compared to previous decades (2.49 % in 1970–1990, 1.7 % in 1990– 
2000) due to various biotic and abiotic stresses (Khush and Jena 2009). The integration  
of recent molecular tools to classical rice breeding programs offers substantial opportu- 
nities toward breaking the yield barrier. Molecular markers have been utilized for long  
time through (i) marker-assisted selection (MAS) strategies for germplasm improve- 
ment and novel cultivar development, (ii) gene pyramiding for accumulating multiple  
genes for resistance to specific or family of pathogens and pests, (iii) examining allelic  
diversity in natural populations or breeding material and association mapping of genomic  
regions related to the desired traits, and (iv) providing DNA fingerprinting barcodes to  
diverse genotypes for plant variety protection. Candidate gene-based functional markers  
can be used for precision breeding. The “advanced backcross QTL analysis” and “exotic  
libraries” are other approaches that increase the efficiency of harnessing natural biodi- 
versity to improve yield, adaptation, and quality of elite germplasm. 
   The exponential development in genomics, next-generation sequencing (NGS),  
and associated DNA technologies in recent years represents a quantum leap in our  
molecular understanding of important plant breeding traits. Advanced marker tech- 
nologies,  such  as  single-nucleotide  polymorphisms  (SNPs)  or  more  recently  the  
paradigm  shift  with  microarray,  RNA  sequencing  (RNA-Seq),  and  chromatin  
immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-Seq) techniques, open a totally new hori- 
zon to improve the efficiency of breeding programs. Powerful reverse genetic strate- 
gies allow the detection of induced point mutations in individuals of the mutagenized  
populations. It can address the major challenge of linking sequence information to  
the  biological  function  of  genes  and  can  also  identify  novel  variation  for  plant  
breeding. Multiple rice mutant resources that are key tools for functional analysis of  
genes  have  been  developed  and  are  available  in  public  domain  (Hirochika  et  al.  
2004). A searchable FST database, which contains 55,000 mutant lines with func- 
tions  of  gene  trap  and  gene  knockout  and  activation  tagging,  is  available  at  the  
Taiwan  Rice  Insertional  Mutant  (TRIM)  website  (http://trim.sinica.edu.tw/). The  
available mutant seeds are provided upon request (Hsing et al. 2007). 
   DNA markers have enormous potential to improve the efficiency and precision  
of conventional plant breeding via MAS. DNA markers have been used in almost all  
aspects of rice improvement. Application of MAS in rice breeding can be broadly  
classified  into  marker-assisted  evaluation  of  breeding  material,  marker-assisted  
backcrossing,     pyramiding,     early  generation     selection,  and    combined     MAS  
 (strategical combination of phenotypic screening with MAS), although there may  
be overlap between these categories (Collard and Mackill 2008). 
   Various plant tissue culture techniques have been applied for crop improvement  
for more than 30 years. While in vitro fertilization can be used to avoid physiological  
incompatibility in both interspecific and intergeneric crosses, embryo rescue tech- 
nique has been utilized against post-zygotic embryo abortion due to poor  endosperm  
development  (International  Rice  Research  Institute  2013).  Unique  hybrid  plants,  
which  cannot  be  produced  by  conventional  sexual  hybridization  methods,  can  be

generated using protoplast fusion. These techniques provide opportunity to utilize  
genetic resources from distant relatives of rice. Similarly double haploid plants are  
highly important for geneticists to study the recessive gene functions and for plant  
breeders in terms of generating homozygous breeding lines within no time. 
    Genetic engineering, an important avenue for enhancing sustainable productivity in  
agriculture,  transcends  the  reproductive  or  phylogenetic  barriers  facilitating  precise  
transfer of traits. Several transgenic rice lines have been developed for biotic/abiotic  
stress resistance, herbicide tolerance, and improvement of nutritional value as well as  
to improve the quality of rice grains (Endo et al.  2007). Rapid improvement in the  
genetic engineering techniques such as “marker-free transgenics” and targeted genome  
engineering using TALENs and CRISPR/Cas9 system provide better scope for intro- 
duction of new genetic material to the targeted location in the genome. Modern bio- 
technology tools have complemented to conventional trait- based selection approach to  
accelerate the rice improvement in several programs which are discussed below. 

18.2      Improving Nutrition and Quality 

Micronutrient malnutrition or hidden hunger is a serious health problem worldwide,  
particularly in the developing countries. Micronutrients, often referred as vitamins  
and minerals, are required in minor quantities to produce enzymes, hormones, and  
other substances that are essential for growth and development. Absence of these  
micronutrients poses severe consequences in the overall growth and development of  
the human body. Humans obtain micronutrients from the food chain. Deficiencies  
occur when people do not get access to micronutrient-rich food items such as fruits,  
vegetables, animal products, and fortified food due to their high costs. With a large  
part of the world’s population living on less than two dollars a day, staple crops such  
as rice play the key role in providing the daily micronutrient needs. Rice is the pre- 
dominant dietary energy source for 17 countries in Asia and the Pacific, 9 countries  
in North and South America, and 8 countries in Africa (Hegde and Hegde 2013). It  
supplies 30 % of the total dietary energy supply in the world. The milled rice grains  
contain  low  levels  of  iron,  folate,  zinc,  provitamin  A,  and  vitamin  E.  Previous  
attempts tried supplementation and fortification-based interventions to furnish the  
much needed micronutrients in cereals and other crops. In spite of the sizable suc- 
cess, such interventions failed to eradicate the problem because of laborious under- 
taking and expensive distribution logistics. Other factors such as mismanagement,  
underfunding, and poor compliance that arises due to economic crisis and political  
turmoil make such type of interventions unsustainable. 
   Biofortification takes advantage of the regular daily intake of staple food by all  
family members. It targets low-income household and hard to reach areas with  limited  
access to commercially available fortified foods. Biofortification aims to develop rice  
cultivars  with  abundant  vitamin  and  mineral  nutrients  through  traditional  plant  
 breeding methods and transgenic approaches. Genomic-based strategies have been  
applied to identify functional profile of candidate genes that will allow the  development  
of nutrient-rich rice cultivars. Multiple genes associated with production and storage

of micronutrients into the rice endosperm can be integrated into a single rice cultivar  
to produce a high micronutrient density variety. Biofortification can also give rise to  
superior rice varieties with combined high micronutrient density and high yield traits.  
Recent advancement in the field of gene discovery and biotechnology makes such  
interventions feasible and cost effective. Once biofortified crops are developed, there  
are no other recurring costs except those involved in maintenance breeding. 

18.2.1       Iron and Zinc Content  

Iron, zinc, and vitamin A deficiency are recognized as the most common forms of  
micronutrient deficiency. Iron deficiency alone affects about 2 billion people, and  
vitamin A deficiency affects at least 100 million children each year, of which 1.3– 
2.5 million die and over 0.25 million suffer permanent health defects such as blind- 
ness. Nearly 30 % of the world’s population may face the risk of iodine deficiency.  
Inadequate diet owing to poverty is the most important reason for zinc deficiency  
that diminishes appetite and adversely affects the immune response. The polished  
rice contains an average of only 2 parts per million (ppm) iron (Fe) and 12 ppm of  
zinc (Zn) (International Rice Research Institute  2006). Several screening studies  
have been undertaken to identify rice cultivars with higher iron and zinc content  
(Anuradha et al. 2012; Sardar et al. 2015; Jahan et al. 2013). 

18.2.1.1      Marker-Assisted Breeding 

Initial  germplasm  screening  and  field  evaluation  of  breeding  lines  from  Korea,  
Bangladesh, Indonesia, India, and the Philippines has shown that iron and zinc con- 
tent in polished rice can be increased by a factor of 2–4 (International Rice Research  
Institute  2006). Jalmagna, a traditional floating rice variety of Eastern India, has  
almost double the iron concentration of IR64 as well as nearly 40 % more zinc.  
Madhukar, a popular variety in some rainfed and deepwater areas of Eastern India,  
had slightly high iron density and very high zinc density. Other known zinc-efficient  
rice varieties that can be exploited for zinc or iron content through breeding include  
Kuatik Putih, Bille Kagga, Getu, Zuchem, and Xua Bue Nuo. 
    Three groups of genes were found to be associated with the high-iron trait. These  
groups of genes were located on chromosomes 7, 8, and 9 and explained 19–30 %  
of the variation in iron content. Permanent mapping populations of F8 recombinant  
inbred lines (RILs) were developed to map high-iron and high-zinc traits. 

18.2.1.2      Transgenic Research 

Iron concentration was observed to be significantly correlated with zinc concentra- 
tion (Anuradha et al. 2012). Although concentration of these trace minerals is mod- 
erately affected by soil properties and weather, breeding for higher iron and zinc  
content can be done side by side (Vasconcelos et al. 2003).

18   Role of Biotechnology in Rice Production                                                491 

    The  entire  coding  sequence  of  soybean  endosperm-specific  ferritin  gene  was  
transferred into Oryza sativa (L.) cv. Kitaake to improve iron content in rice (Goto  
et al.  1999). Ferritin is an intracellular protein present in all organisms responsible  
for storing iron and releasing it in a controlled manner when needed (http://www. 
chemistry.wustl.edu/). In a different study, the human lactoferrin gene was expressed  
in rice for higher bioavailability (Nandi et al. 2002). Human lactoferrin is the major  
iron-binding protein in breast milk. Its expression in transgenic rice was stable for  
more than five generation. However, expression of lactoferrin was able to only dou- 
ble the iron content in rice grains unlike two- to threefold increase observed in the  
soybean ferritin expression (Lonnerdal 2003). 
    In another attempt, the ferritin (pfe ) gene from Phaseolus vulgaris (common bean)  
was introduced into rice along with two other genes – Aspergillus fumigatus phytase  
(phyA ) and an endogenous cysteine-rich metallothionein-like (rgMT) protein (Lucca  
and  Hurrell  2001).  Cysteine  peptides  formed  in  the  digestive  system  enhance  iron  
absorption, while the enzyme phytase hydrolyzes phytic acid. Phytic acid present in  
plant seeds chelates multivalent metal ions such as iron and zinc forming insoluble salts  
with low bioavailability (Zhou and Erdman  1995). Resulting seeds of the transgenic  
rice showed sevenfold increase in cysteine residues and 130-fold increase in phytase  
level. Further study by Hong et al. (2004) in Taiwan showed the potential of increasing  
phytase in transgenic rice by the incorporation of two bacterial genes derived from  
ruminal bacterium  Selenomonas ruminantium (SrPf6) and  Escherichia coli (appA).  
The expressions of these genes produce phytases highly active under broad pH ranges  
of 3.0–5.5 and 2.0–6.0 and with optimal temperature at 55 and 60 °C, respectively.  
Overexpression of MxIRT1, a ferrous transporter from an iron-efficient genotype of the  
apple  tree,  Malus  xiaojinensis,  showed  active  transport  of  iron  (Tan  et  al.  2015a).  
Concerted expression of AtIRT1 , AtNAS1 , and PvFERRITIN synergistically increased  
iron in both polished and unpolished rice grains (Boonyaves et al. 2015). 

18.2.2       Vitamin A 

Many countries with a high prevalence of vitamin A deficiency (VAD) rely on rice  
as a major source of energy. Rice does not contain β-carotene, the direct precursor  
of vitamin A. Existing rice cultivars are not capable of accumulating provitamin A  
in the grain. Germplasm screening conducted by various rice institutions and private  
companies showed that there are no cultivars of rice that can be used as parental line  
for  vitamin A  biofortification  using  traditional  breeding  methods.  Key  pathway  
enzymes in β-carotene synthesis are only expressed in the vegetative tissues of rice  
plants.  However,  immature  rice  endosperm  is  capable  of  synthesizing  the  early  
intermediate of  β-carotene called geranylgeranyl diphosphate. While this isopren- 
oid  precursor  is  synthesized  in  the  endosperm,  conversion  of  this  to  β-carotene  
requires the enzyme phytoene synthase along with three other plant enzymes – phy- 
toene desaturase and  ξ-carotene desaturase, each catalyzing the establishment of  
double bonds, and lycopene β-cyclase, encoded by the lcy gene. 
    The engineering of biosynthetic pathway of provitamin A (β-carotene) into the rice  
endosperm  was  first  reported  by  Xudong Ye  and  his  colleagues  in  2000  (Ye  and  

----------------------- Page 491-----------------------

492                                                                                A.K. Biswal et al. 

Al-Babili 2000) (Table  18.2). Since immature rice endosperm is capable to produce  
the  precursor  of  β-carotene,  geranylgeranyl  diphosphate,  genetic  engineering  was  
used to introduce other key enzymes needed in  β-carotene synthesis pathway. The  
phytoene synthase (psy ) gene was introduced through Agrobacterium- mediated trans- 
formation to convert geranylgeranyl diphosphate to phytoene, the immediate precur- 
sor of β-carotene in plants. In Golden Rice 1, the phytoene desaturase and ξ-carotene  
desaturase, involved in catalyzing the introduction of two double bonds, were replaced  
by a bacterial carotene desaturase (crtI), which was capable of introducing all four  
double bonds. Golden Rice 2 was developed with homologs of the same genes that  
were used in Golden Rice 1 and encode enzymes with similar activities. The psy gene  
for Golden Rice 2 was isolated from maize, while it came from daffodil (Narcissus  
pseudonareissus ) for Golden Rice 1 (Paine et al. 2005). 
    Golden Rice 2 had an increase in total carotenoids of up to 23-fold (maximum 37  
μg/g) compared to Golden Rice 1 and a preferential accumulation of  β-carotene,  
resulting to a deep orange color (Paine et al. 2005). With significantly higher level  
of β-carotene, the consumption of Golden Rice 2 in typical quantities may provide  
adequate daily intake of vitamin A in countries in which rice is a staple food, assum- 
ing cooking losses of β-carotene are not excessive. If approved for human consump- 
tion, Golden Rice 2 could provide adequate levels of vitamin A to large populations  
that are currently at risk for VAD. Golden Rice 2 may also be useful even for popu- 
lations where rice is a smaller dietary component. 

18.3       Improvement of Abiotic Stress Resistance 

Global  environmental  changes  (GEC)  have  posed  a  threat  to  rice  production.  
Various abiotic stresses such as drought, flooding, soil salinization, extremely low  
and high temperatures, and other adverse environmental conditions result in major  
loss to rice yield. Though high-yielding varieties are mostly susceptible, wide vari- 
ation exists in rice gene pool, which is being utilized to improve the cultivated  
varieties. 

18.3.1       Drought  

Drought  is  a  complex  physiological  phenomenon  of  widespread  significance  for  
agriculture. It is among the most severe factors which affect rice yield and grain  
quality. It has been termed as the single most common cause of severe food scarcity  
in developing countries. From agronomic point of view, drought is a period when  
soil moisture is inadequate to meet the demands for crops to initiate and sustain  
plant growth. In rainfed areas, upon failure of rain or a long interval between two  
rains, drought stress can occur at the seedling, vegetative, or reproductive stage of  
the rice crop, and it can also be intermittent depending upon the rainfall pattern and

18   Role of Biotechnology in Rice Production                                           493 

distribution. In fact, drought often has neither a distinct start nor end. The reproduc- 
tive stage drought has been identified as the most detrimental to grain yield (O’Toole  
1982) and a short period of drought during this stage can lead to substantial yield  
loss. 
   Poor water management, increased competition for limited water resources, and  
the uncertain threats associated with global warming all highlight the looming water  
crisis that threatens agricultural productivity worldwide. More than 23 million ha  
(20 %) of the total rice area in Asia is subjected to drought of different intensities  
(Pandey and Bhandari 2009; Pandey et al. 2007). Development and dissemination  
of a climate-smart drought-tolerant rice varieties can increase the annual rice pro- 
duction up to 6 million tons worth US$ 3.3 billion (Mottaleb et al. 2016). Hence,  
there is an urgent need to develop climate-resilient rice cultivars, which can give  
higher yield under drought and boost the income of resource poor farmers. 
   Drought resistance includes drought escape (DE) via a short life cycle or devel- 
opmental plasticity; drought avoidance (DA) via enhanced water uptake and reduced  
water loss; drought tolerance (DT) via osmotic adjustment (OA), antioxidant capac- 
ity, and desiccation tolerance; and drought recovery (DR) mainly through high veg- 
etative vigor (Chang et al.  1986) (Fig.  18.1). Different rice varieties use different  
physicochemical methods that again vary at different developmental stages (Tripathy  
et al.  2000).The ability to maintain water uptake during drought appears to be a  
major attribute that confers increased drought resistance on traditional rice varieties,  
and hence increased rooting depth and density would increase the capacity to extract  
available water. Chang et al. (Chang et al. 1986) found that rice cultivars with deep  
root systems avoided drought better than those with more shallow root systems. The  
ability to resist the adverse effect of drought has also been reported to be directly  
proportional to the density and concentration of root development in wheat (Hurd  
1964). Application of molecular markers and high-density SNP genotyping array to  
look for parental polymorphism and root-specific gene expression can be exploited  
for drought tolerance of rice (Chen et al. 2014). 

18.3.1.1     Marker-Assisted Breeding 

Progress in breeding for drought resistance has been slow mainly due to a wide  
range of water stress environments found in rice-growing areas, difference in time,  
intensity, and hydrology of drought. Furthermore, drought stress is accompanied by  
other stresses like high temperature and nutrient deficiencies, which further compli- 
cate the breeding efforts. Traditional varieties, N22, Laloo 14, Brown gora, Birsa  
gora, Dular, etc., are known to have high drought tolerance. However, most of these  
lines are early in duration and carry unfavorable linkage drag. On the other hand,  
some released varieties, such as Annada and Vandana in India and Apo and PSBRc82  
and PSBRc68 in the Philippines, possess good drought tolerance. 
   Conventional breeding for drought tolerance in rice has met with little success  
(Fukai and Cooper 1995) due to the polygenic nature of the phenomenon with low  
heritability and high G×E interaction (Zhang and Creelman 2004; McWilliam 1989;

Ingram  and  Bartels  1996).  With  recent  advances  in  marker-assisted  selection,  
 several international and national programs working on rice have generated system- 
atic programs to develop effective drought-tolerant cultivars. Over the past decade,  
many drought researchers have shifted to direct selection of large-effect QTLs for  
higher grain yield (GY) under drought stress against the earlier thought that herita- 
bility (H) of yield under drought stress might be low. Most of these programs evalu- 
ate advanced lines under both drought stress and irrigated control situations to select  
lines  combining  high  yield  under  both  situations.  However,  proper  drought-  
phenotyping protocols for inducing an appropriate level of drought stress in screen- 
ing  experiments  that  result  in  a  clear  differentiation  of  drought-tolerant  and  
drought-susceptible lines still need improvement and standardization. 
     Drought is an ideal trait for improvement through MAS though it has been dif- 
ficult to be managed through conventional phenotypic selection. The recent prog- 
ress made in the field of genomics offers new opportunities to dissect QTLs for  
drought tolerance. Initial approaches included the secondary physiological traits as  
the targets for selection. Significant genetic variability has been found in the root-  
associated traits, especially root morphology and ability to penetrate compact soil  
layers (Nguyen and Joshi 1994). Several QTLs associated with different parameters  
of rice root morphology, i.e., root length, thickness, root/shoot ratio, root dry weight  
per tiller, deep root dry weight per tiller, maximum root length, and root penetration

ability, have been identified (Champoux et al.  1995; Price et al. 2000; Steele et al.  
2006). A study on RILs developed from a cross between Co39 and Moroborekan  
showed that osmotic adjustment and dehydration tolerance were negatively con- 
nected  with  root  morphological  characters  associated  with  drought  avoidance  
(Lilley et al. 1996). Shen et al. (2001) conducted a marker-assisted backcross breed- 
ing program to transfer the deeper root alleles of Azucena into the elite high- yielding  
cultivar  IR64.  QTLs  for  drought  avoidance  using  other  traits  have  also  been  
explored. Courtois et al. (2000) also identified 42 QTLs for drought-related traits in  
rice among which 11 were for leaf rolling, 10 for leaf drying, 11 for relative water  
content, and 10 for relative growth rate under stress. Due to the complex polygenic  
nature of drought resistance, major QTLs have been considered for effective toler- 
ance. Obara et al. (2010) mapped a major QTL qRL6.1 for root length, on chromo- 
some 6 in rice seedlings. Steele et al. (2006) improved the root morphological traits  
of Indian upland rice cultivar Kalinga III through marker-assisted backcross breed- 
ing with Azucena, an upland japonica variety from the Philippines. 
   The identification of QTLs with a major effect on grain yield raises new hopes of  
improving grain yield under drought through marker-assisted breeding (Table  18.1).  
The first large-effect QTL, qDTY12.1, for grain yield under reproductive-stage drought  
was reported in the Vandana/Way Rarem population explaining nearly 51% of the  
genetic variance (Bernier et al. 2009, 2007; Dixit et al. 2015). Major QTLs have also  
been reported for grain yield under lowland drought stress explaining 32 and 36 % of  
the genetic variance (Kumar et al. 2007; Venuprasad et al. 2009). Another major QTL  
for grain yield under reproductive-stage drought stress (qDTY1.1) showed an additive  
effect of 29.3 %, 24.3 %, and 16.1 % on mean yield in N22/Swarna, N22/IR64, and  
N22/MTU1010, respectively (Vikram et al. 2011). It also showed a positive effect on  
GY in non-stress situations. The grain yield under reproductive-stage drought stress of  
popular  rice  varieties Vandana  and  IR64  has  been  successfully  improved  through  
identification of large-effect QTLs (qDTY2.2, qDTY4.1, qDTY9.1, qDTY10.1, and  
qDTY12.1) and marker-assisted backcross breeding (Mishra et al. 2013; Swamy et al.  
2013). Direct selection of GY under drought has led to the successful development  
and release of 17 high-yielding drought-tolerant rice varieties in South Asia, Southeast  
Asia, and Africa as well as 14 QTLs showing a large effect against high-yielding  
drought-susceptible popular varieties (Kumar et al. 2014). 

18.3.1.2     Transgenic Research 

While  molecular  biologists  are  gathering  more  and  more  information  about  the  
mechanism of drought tolerance, information regarding transgenic rice lines that  
show  increased  drought  stress  tolerance  is  being  generated  fast  (Table  18.2).  
However, molecular basis underlying the improved drought tolerance of these trans- 
genic rice plants remains largely unclear. Most of the transgenic lines have been  
developed by expressing transcription factors or other genes targeting secondary  
traits like root system architecture (RSA), water use efficiency (WUE), antioxidants  
and other metabolites, etc.

    There are several reports that transgenic rice plants show higher grain yields than  
their  wild  relatives  under  drought  treatment.  The  increase  in  grain  yield  of  the  
 transgenic plants has mainly been attributed to larger panicle sizes and higher tiller  
numbers  (Todaka  et  al.  2015).Transcription  factors  have  been  suggested  to  play  
important roles in the regulation or reprogramming of the gene expression associ- 
ated with plant stress responses. Overexpression of a NAC (NAM, ATAF and CUC)  
transcription factor SNAC1 significantly enhanced drought resistance in transgenic  
rice (22–34 % higher seed setting than control) in the field under severe drought  
stress  conditions  at  the  vegetative  and  reproductive  stage  without  showing  any  
 phenotypic changes or yield penalty (Hu et al. 2006). Similarly, overexpression of  
OsNAC6 in rice plants was observed to increase tolerance to drought and salinity  
stresses  (Nakashima  et  al.  2007).  Overexpression  of  transcriptional  regulators  
OsbZIP23 and OsbZIP16 that function through an ABA-dependent regulatory path- 
way resulted in transgenic rice plants with enhanced tolerance to drought and salin- 
ity stresses (Chen et al. 2012; Xiang et al. 2008). Transgenic rice plants expressing  
AtDREB1A under the control of the stress-inducible RD29 promoter and AtDREB1C  
driven by a stress-inducible rice lip9 promoter showed higher tolerance to dehydra- 
tion (Datta et al. 2012; Ishizaki et al. 2013). 
    Late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins are important stress-inducible pro- 
teins  involved  in  cellular  protection  against  stresses  (Hong  and  Uknes  1988).  
Transgenic rice plants expressing different LEA proteins showed increased toler- 
ance to drought and salinity stresses (Xu et al. 1996; Xiao et al. 2007; Duan 2012).  
ABA-signaling unit composed of OsPYL/RCAR5, OsPP2C30, SAPK2, and OREB1  
was also used for the transgenic purpose in different rice varieties and found better  
adaptation under drought stress (Todaka et al. 2015). 
    Wang et al. (2005) used the pea manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), an  
important antioxidant enzyme, under the control of a stress-inducible SWPA2 pro- 
moter to generate transgenic rice lines which showed improved drought tolerance.  
Gu  et  al.  (2013)  developed  a  transgenic  rice  lines  with  maize-specific  pyruvate  
orthophosphate dikinase (PPDK) independently and in combination with the maize  
C4-specific phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PCK) which exhibited higher grain  
yields than wild-type (WT) plants under soil drought conditions. 
    Changes in membrane integrity and modulation of lipid synthesis are important  
factors in the primary sensing of abiotic stress (Kader 2010). Transgenic rice plants  
overexpressing  OsCPK4,  a  calcium-dependent  protein  kinase,  exhibited  stronger  
water-holding capability and reduced levels of membrane lipid peroxidation and  
electrolyte  leakage  under  drought  or  salt  stress  condition  (Campo  et  al.  2016).  
Similarly,  transgenic  rice  plants,  overexpressing  OsSIK1  and  OsSIK2  [putative  
receptor-like  kinase  (RLK)],  showed  enhanced  tolerance  to  drought  and  salinity  
stresses (Ouyang et al. 2010; Chen et al. 2013). Transgenic rice plants expressing  
many other candidate genes such as lipid transfer protein gene  OsDIL (O. sativa  
drought-induced LTP), (Guo and Ge 2013), heat shock protein gene OsHsp17.0 or  
OsHsp23.7 (Zou et al.  2012), and Arabidopsis glycine-rich RNA-binding protein  
AtGRP2 or AtGRP7 genes (Yang et al. 2014) have been reported to show enhanced  
drought tolerance. Disruption of squalene synthase (SQS) gene function by RNA

interference  has  also  been  found  to  improve  drought  tolerance  in  rice  plants  
(Manavalan et al. 2012). 
    Although  several  studies  have  reported  transgenic  rice  plants  with  improved  
drought tolerance during field trials, further research is needed to uncover the regu- 
latory mechanism of drought response and tolerance under field conditions. Such  
investigations should lead to the discovery of new genes that increase drought toler- 
ance without yield penalty under well-watered as well as drought conditions. 

18.3.2       Salinity 

Salinity is one of the major impediments for enhancing production in rice-growing  
areas worldwide. Rice shows varied level of tolerance to salinity at different devel- 
opmental stages. Though rice is relatively tolerant to salinity during germination,  
active tillering, and maturity, it is highly sensitive during the early seedling stage  
and reproductive stage (Ismail et al. 2007; Munns 2008; Singh and Redoña 2010).  
Thus, the seedling and reproductive stages are the most vulnerable to salt stress,  
with considerable impacts on survival and grain yield. One-fifth of irrigated arable  
lands in the world have been reported to be adversely influenced by high soil salin- 
ity (Negrão and Courtois 2011). Over 800 million ha of land is severely salt affected  
worldwide, while approximately 20 % of irrigated areas (about 45 million ha) are  
estimated to suffer from salinization problems of various degrees. 

18.3.2.1     Marker-Assisted Breeding 

Salinity is particularly a major problem in coastal regions in the tropics because of  
the intrusion of brackish water during the dry season and at the start of the wet sea- 
son into rice field. Salt stress is also worsening due to buildup of salinity as a con- 
sequence of excessive use of irrigation water with improper drainage and poor-quality  
irrigation water. Rice shows wide genetic variation with respect to salinity toler- 
ance. Landraces such as Pokkali, Nona Bokra, Damodar, Dasal and Getu, etc. are  
well adapted to grow in saline environments, while modern rice varieties show high  
sensitivity. The salinity tolerance at different growth stages seems to be managed by  
independent genes. A number of mapping studies have identified QTLs associated  
with salinity tolerance in rice (Table 18.1). A cross between tolerant indica landrace  
Nona Bokra with the susceptible japonica Koshihikari led to identification of sev- 
                                                  + 
eral  QTLs  such  as  qSKC-1  for  shoot  K   concentration  on  chromosome  1  and  
qSNC-7 for shoot Na+ concentration (Lin et al. 2004). The SKC1 gene was subse- 
                                                                                                + 
quently  cloned  and  found  to  encode  a  sodium  transporter  that  helps  control  K   
homeostasis under salt stress (Ren et al. 2005). Saltol, a major QTL associated with  
        +   + 
the Na /K  ratio and seedling-stage salinity tolerance, was identified from a RIL  
population developed from indica varieties IR29 and Pokkali (Gregorio  1997). This  
QTL explains 43.2 % of the phenotypic variance and confers salinity tolerance at

the vegetative stage (Bonilla et al. 2016). The availability of the large-effect QTL  
Saltol for salinity tolerance in rice, a theoretical framework for MABC, and the  
existence  of  intolerant  varieties  that  are  widely  accepted  by  farmers  provide  an  
opportunity  to  develop  cultivars  that  would  be  suitable  for  larger  areas  of  
submergence- prone  rice  (MacKill  2008).  One  highly  salt-tolerant  RIL  from  this  
population, FL478 (IR 66946-3R-178-1-1), has been used to improve the salt toler- 
ance of BT7 variety by using marker-assisted backcross (Linh et al. 2012). Lang  
et al. (2008) applied MAS to improve salt tolerance in OMCS2000 rice cultivar, a  
widely grown cultivar in North Vietnam. However, there is no report of robust QTLs  
for  salt  tolerance  at  the  reproductive  stage.  The  main  reason  for  this  is  time-  
consuming and laborious phenotyping protocols needed for the reproductive stage  
as compared with the relatively easy phenotyping protocols for the seedling stage  
(Jena and Mackill 2008). 
    The best known and seemingly most robust QTL is Saltol/SKC1 on the short arm  
of chromosome 1 (Lin et al. 2004). QTLs have been identified in this region in a  
number of populations derived from several donors (Ahmadi et al.  2011; Ul Haq  
et al. 2010), and the candidate gene has been identified to a high degree of confi- 
dence (Ren et al.  2005; Platten et al. 2006). Hossain et al. (Hossain et al.  2015)  
reported that genomic regions on chromosomes 1, 7, 8, and 10 affect salinity toler- 
                                                                + 
ance at the reproductive stage through alterations in Na  uptake, pollen fertility, and  
   +   + 
Na /K  ratio, and these loci are good targets for marker-assisted selection aimed at  
improving  salinity  tolerance.  The  notable  association  of  some  QTLs  with  other  
QTLs for different traits suggests that they have a causal relationship. This would  
help to improve rice varieties for salinity-prone areas where reproductive-stage salt  
stress is a major impediment to rice production especially during the dry season.  
                            +                +   + 
Mechanisms such as Na  exclusion, Na /K  ratio, and pollen fertility may be respon- 
sible for reproductive-stage salt tolerance. Recently, a novel cross was made using  
embryo rescue technique between the exotic wild rice species Oryza coarctata and  
cultivated rice variety IR56 (O. sativa.), spawning a new generation of rice that has  
double  the  salinity  tolerance  of  other  rice  varieties  (International  Rice  Research  
Institute 2013). 

18.3.2.2     Transgenic Research 

Genes for aquaporins (water channel proteins) and late embryogenesis abundant  
(LEA) proteins have been tested in transgenic studies addressing drought and salin- 
ity, but much more work is necessary before we know whether they will be useful  
to breeders and farmers (Table  18.2). Transgenic rice plants harboring the choline  
oxidase  (codA)  gene  from Arthrobacter  globiformis  were  highly  tolerant  to  salt  
stress (Mohanty et al.  2002). Choline oxidase catalyzes conversion of choline to  
glycine betaine, which is known to provide tolerance against a variety of stresses.  
The protective function of glycine betaine has been predicted to be more efficient  
when  produced  in  a  photosynthetic  organelle  (Sakamoto  and  Murata   1998).  
Transgenic rice with chloroplast-targeted  codA gene were more tolerant than the

transgenic plants with the protein localized in the cytosol (Kathuria et al. 2009). The  
potential role of superoxide dismutase (SOD) in the protection against salt stress  
was examined through overexpression in rice (Tanaka et al.  1999). Transgenic rice  
plants expressing HVA 1, driven by the constitutive promoter from the rice actin 1  
gene, showed significant increase in tolerance to salt (Xu et al.  1996). The overex- 
pression of calcium-dependent protein kinase OsCDPK7 gene, which performs the  
Ca2+-stimulated  protein  phosphorylation,  in  rice  resulted  in  higher  salt  tolerance  

(Saijo  et  al.  2000).  Barley  LEA  protein  genes  expressed  in  two  rice  varieties  
enhanced growth under either salt or drought stress (Rohila and Jain 2002; Chandra  
Babu et al. 2004). 

18.3.3       Flood and Submergence  

Flooding and submergence are recurring problems for rice farming, especially in  
the lowlands of South and Southeast Asia. Since most of the economically high-  
yielding varieties are intolerant to flooding, farmers in these areas depend on tradi- 
tional  low-yielding  varieties  that  can  tolerate  flooded  conditions.  In  the  rainfed  
lowland areas of Eastern India, submergence is the third most important limitation  
to rice production among 42 biotic and abiotic stresses, and it is surpassed only by  
drought and weeds (Widawsky and O’Toole 1996). The expression of submergence  
tolerance genes is known to be environmentally dependent and genetically complex  
(Setter et al.  1997). One of the ways that has enabled rice to adapt to flooding has  
recently  been  identified  as  a  “quiescence  strategy”  (Bailey-Serres  and Voesenek  
2008). It is characterized by reduced plant elongation during submergence associ- 
ated with regrowth when the water recedes. An ethylene-responsive factor (ERF),  
Sub1A, is the key determinant of this survival mechanism (Xu et al. 2006). Sub1A-1  
is induced by ethylene, a gaseous plant hormone that becomes entrapped by water  
submergence (Perata 2007). 

18.3.3.1      Marker-Assisted Breeding 

Genetic studies suggest both simple and quantitative inheritance for submergence  
tolerance. Breeding of improved varieties to overcome the problem of submergence  
has mainly relied on FR13A, a tolerant landrace from Odisha, India that can tolerate  
complete inundation for 10–14 days (Mackill et al. 1993). Using population derived  
from a cross between a submergence-tolerant indica line (IR40931-26) and a sus- 
ceptible japonica  line (“P1543851”), a major QTL was finely mapped near the cen- 
tromere of chromosome 9, designated as Submergence 1 (Sub1). The locus showed  
70 % of phenotypic variation in submergence tolerance. There are a cluster of three  
genes at Sub1 locus, encoding putative ethylene response factors (ERFs)/ethylene-  
responsive  element-binding  proteins/APETALA2-like  proteins  (Xu  et  al.  2006;  
Perata 2007). All three Sub1 region genes fall in the B-2 subclass of ERF proteins,  

----------------------- Page 507-----------------------

508                                                                              A.K. Biswal et al. 

which contains a single 58- to 59-residue ERF domain. Two of these genes, Sub1B  
and Sub1C, are invariably present in the Sub1 region of all rice accessions analyzed.  
In contrast, the presence of Sub1A is variable. A survey identified two alleles within  
indica varieties that possess this gene: a tolerance-specific allele named  Sub1A-1  
and an intolerance-specific allele named Sub1A-2. Overexpression of Sub1A-1 in a  
submergence-intolerant  O.  sativa  ssp. japonica   conferred  enhanced  tolerance  to  
submergence, downregulation of Sub1C, and upregulation of Alcohol dehydroge - 
nase 1 (Adh1), indicating that Sub1A-1 is a primary determinant of submergence  
tolerance. The molecular mechanism behind the deepwater rice responses through  
the  identification  of  the  genes,  viz.,  SNORKEL1  (SK1)  and  SNORKEL2  (SK2),  
which trigger deepwater response by encoding ethylene response factors involved  
in ethylene signaling (Hattori et al.  2009). The products of  SK1 and  SK2 trigger  
remarkable internode elongation via gibberellin. The deepwater rice C9285 pos- 
sesses SK1 and SK2, although both genes are absent in the non-deepwater rice T65.  
SK1 and SK2 possess a putative nuclear localization signal and a single APETALA2/ 
ethylene  response  factor  (AP2/ERF)  domain.  The  SK  genes  were  significantly  
expressed under deepwater conditions, whereas these expressions were low under  
dry conditions in C9285. Overexpression of SK1 gene drove elongation one to three  
internodes, and SK2 overproducers elongated one to seven internodes, even under  
dry conditions (Hattori et al. 2009). The Sub1 gene, derived from the tolerant variety  
FR13A, has been transferred to a number of widely grown varieties, allowing them  
to withstand complete submergence for up to 2 weeks. The IR64- Sub1 cultivar car- 
rying  QTL/Sub1  gene  was  successfully  used  in  backcross  breeding  programs  to  
alter the submergence tolerance of improved high-yielding Vietnamese rice culti- 
vars (Lang et al. 2013; Lang and Buu 2011; Submergence et al. 2013). 
    Four QTLs were identified in a cross between two moderately tolerant varieties  
IR72 and Madabaru, on chromosomes 1, 2, 9, and 12. The largest QTL on chromo- 
                                                       2 
some 1 which had a LOD score of 11.2 and R  of 52.3 % was found in a non-Sub1  
locus and had the tolerant allele from IR72 which suggests that an alternative path- 
way may be present in this variety that is independent of the ethylene-dependent  
pathway mediated by the Sub1A gene (Septiningsih et al. 2012). These novel QTLs  
can  be  combined  with  Sub1  using  marker-assisted  backcrossing  in  an  effort  to  
enhance the level of submergence tolerance for flood-prone areas (Table  18.1). 

18.3.3.2      Transgenic Research 

Two  different  approaches  have  been  used  to  try  and  identify  limiting  factors  in  
response to waterlogging (Table 18.2). First is the under-expression of single candi- 
date genes, e.g., for ethanol synthesis, using sense and antisense constructs. Second  
is the overexpression of transcription factors (Dennis et al. 2000). It was anticipated  
that both approaches may have a beneficial effect in switching on the longer-term  
adaptation response to low oxygen stress. Quimio et al. (2000) found that Taipei 309  
transformed with pyruvate decarboxylase (pdc1 ) linked to a constitutive 35S pro- 
moter had up to threefold higher PDC activities and ethanol synthesis rates when

exposed to anoxia compared to non-transformed controls. They also reported that  
increasing ethanol production up to sixfold in a range of transgenic lines exposed to  
anoxia was correlated with an eightfold increase in percentage survival of lines dur- 
ing submergence under hypoxic conditions. In contrast, Rahaman et al. (2001) stud- 
ied Taipei 309 transformed with pdc1 and found that two transgenic lines had over  
twofold greater PDC activity and they had up to 43 % greater rate of ethanol synthe- 
sis; however, survival of seed lines exposed to anoxia was even less than that of  
non-transformed plants. They observed similar results for transgenic rice expressing  
the cotton alcohol dehydrogenase adh2cDNA. Therefore, the results of transgenic  
rice need to be repeated for its potential extrapolation. 

18.4       Improvement of Biotic Stress Resistance 

On average, farmers lose 37 % of their rice yield to pests and diseases, and these  
losses  can  range  between  24  and  41  %  depending  on  the  production  situation  
(Sparks et al. 2012). While many of these can be handled with management prac- 
tices, often it is not the viable option due to financial and educational status of the  
farmers and unavailability of the pesticides. 

18.4.1       Disease Resistance  

18.4.1.1      Blast Disease 

Rice blast is among the diseases that cause highest damage to the grain yield among  
all diseases (Lee 1983). The fungus Magnaporthe oryzae is the causal agent of rice  
blast.  It  is  a  haploid  filamentous  ascomycete  with  a  relatively  small  genome  of  
~40 Mb divided into seven chromosomes (Dean 2005). The fungus causes disease  
at seedling and adult stages on the leaves, nodes, and panicles. Sesma and Osbourn  
(Sesma 2004) reported a new facet of the M. oryzae life cycle, where the fungus can  
undergo a different and previously uncharacterized set of programmed developmen- 
tal events that are typical of root-infecting pathogens. 

Marker-Assisted Breeding 

Conventional genetic analyses of identified donors with resistance, availability of  
pure isolates of the blast pathogen, and advanced molecular analysis techniques have  
resulted in identification of more than 100 genes for resistance to M. oryzae (Sharma  
2012) and have been designated as Pi1-Pi62, Pii, Pia, Pib, Pik, Pi-kh (same as Pi54),  
Pit, Pita, Pita 2, Pitp, Pish, etc. (Wang et al. 2014a). A genome- wide association  
study  based  on  genotyping  0.8  million  single-nucleotide  polymorphism  variants

across 366 diverse  indica accessions identified thirty associated loci (Wang et al.  
2014b).  Marker-assisted  backcross  breeding  (MABB)  approach  was  employed  to  
incorporate blast resistance genes, viz., Piz-5 and Pi54, from the donor lines C101A51  
and Tetep into the genetic background of PRR78 to develop Pusa1602 (PRR78 +  
Piz5) and Pusa1603 (PRR78 + Pi54), respectively (Singh et al. 2012). 

Transgenic Research 

Homozygous transgenic rice lines harboring rice blast resistance gene Pi-d2 showed  
high resistance to disease incidence of neck blast (Chen et al.  2010). Microarray  
analysis of transgenic rice Taipei 309 (TP) carrying Pi54 gene indicated activation  
of defense response and transcription factor-related genes and a higher expression  
of  key  enzymes  involved  in  the  defense  response  pathway  (Gupta  et  al.  2012).  
Asghar  et  al.  (2007)  attempted  to  improve  basmati  rice  against  fungal  infection  
through  gene  transfer  technology.  Transgenic  plants  with  rice  class-I  chitinase  
genes, Cht-2 or  Cht-3, showed significantly higher resistance against the rice blast  
pathogen Magnaporthe grisea races 007.0 and 333 (Nishizawa et al.  1999). Other  
reports  include  plant  antitoxin  gene  (Stark-Lorenzen  et  al.   1997),  chitinase-  
glucanase gene (Daorong et al. 1999), trichosanthin gene (Ming et al. 2000), wasabi  
phytoalexin gene (Kanzaki et al. 2002), and rice blast resistance genes Pi-ta, Pi-9,  
Pi-2, etc. (Table  18.2). 

18.4.1.2     Sheath Blight (ShB) 

Rice  ShB  pathogen  produces  toxin  that  induces  characteristic  symptoms  on  rice  
leaves  and  wilting  of  seedlings  and  inhibits  rice  radicle  growth.  Over  the  past  
decades, studies on resistance to ShB have been conducted by many researchers  
who have had diverse objectives, including screening of the germplasm of culti- 
vated rice and its wild relatives, assessment of genetically engineered plants with  
genes for resistance, and phenotyping for QTL mapping or validation (Table  18.1).  
Sources of ShB resistance have been sought for in different rice-growing regions.  
These studies resulted in the identification of genotypes with moderate to high lev- 
els of resistance. 

Marker-Assisted Breeding 

Both wild species and landraces of the Oryza genus possess under-exploited alleles  
that may have a strong potential for the improvement of Asian rice (Oryza sativa L.)  
and African rice (Oryza glaberrima Steud.). Over the years, a very large number of  
accessions  from  different  species  of  Oryza  have  been  tested  at  IRRI  to  identify  
sources for ShB resistance. From a total of 233 accessions tested, 76 were found to  
contain a high level of resistance to ShB, and 29 showed moderate resistance. The

latter accessions belonged to the African rice, O. glaberrima (2n = 24 AA), a close  
relative of O. sativa (2n = 24 AA). The relatively high-resistant accessions belonged  
to mixed genetic groups. In addition to the studies mentioned above, several other  
groups also explored wild accessions or their derivatives for ShB resistance (Amante  
et  al.  1990;  Lakshmanan  2016;  Prasad  and  Eizenga  2008).  Ram  et  al.  (2016)  
screened 11 different species of  Oryza, identifying the accessions of  O. latifolia  
Desv., O. grandiglumis (Doell) Prod, O. nivara, and O. rufipogon as having a higher  
level of resistance. Li et al. ( 1995) identified six QTLs for sheath blight resistance  
in an F4 population of Teqing/Lemont. 

Transgenic Research 

Pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins are produced in response to attack by pathogens  
and are known to play key roles in the plant defense mechanisms. Overexpression  
of PR proteins, including chitinase (PR-3), β-1,3-glucanases (PR-2), thaumatin-like  
proteins (PR-5), and other plant- or microbe-derived antifungal proteins, has been  
used to develop transgenic plants against fungal infection. Chitinases that hydrolyze  
the β-1,4 linkages of N-acetylglucosamine (“chitin”) have been well characterized.  
Overexpression of different chitinases in rice cultivars has been found to result in  
enhanced resistance against ShB (Datta et al. 2001). The expression of Ace-AMP1  
(Patkar and Chattoo 2006) and Dm-AMP1 (Jha et al. 2009) genes resulted not only  
in enhanced resistance against ShB but also against other rice diseases. There have  
been efforts to combine resistance genes to generate plants with increased resis- 
tance to ShB. To date, more than 12 rice cultivars, including IR72, IR64, Chinsurah  
Boro  II,  Basmati  122,  Swarna,  and  IR58,  have  been  transformed  with  different  
genes for ShB resistance. Kalpana et al. (2006) engineered the different lines of elite  
indica rice cultivars, ADT38, ASD16, IR50, and Pusa Basmati1, by constitutively  
overexpressing  rice  tlp  encoding  a  thaumatin-like  protein. The  putative  transfor- 
mants and their progenies expressing  tlp showed enhanced resistance against the  
sheath blight pathogen, Rhizoctonia solani, when compared to the non-transformed  
plants. The combination of rice chi11, encoding a chitinase, along with tlp showed  
enhanced resistance against R. solani than the ones that express either tlp or chi11  
transgene alone (Table  18.2). 

18.4.2       Bacterial Disease  

18.4.2.1      Bacterial Leaf Blight (BLB) 

Bacterial leaf blight or bacterial blight (BB) caused by the pathogen Xanthomonas  
oryzae pv oryzae (Xoo) is one of the most destructive diseases of rice throughout the  
world (Rao and Lakshminarasu  2002). Twenty-six genes conferring resistance to  
various  races  of  the  pathogen  have  been  identified  and  used  in  rice  breeding

dominant while six (xa5, xa8, xa13, xa15, xa19 and xa20) were also found to be  
recessive (Khush  1991; Kinoshita 1995; Lin 1996). At least ten races of the bacte- 
rium have been identified in the Philippines and two other in India. Each race has  
specific virulence to varieties with different resistance genes, showing a gene-for-  
gene relationship in the host-pathogen interaction (Mew 2016; Vera Cruz 1989). 

Marker-Assisted Breeding 

Four  Xa  genes  have  been  cloned  and  six  others  have  been  tagged  with  molecular  
markers and employed for marker-assisted selection and release of resistant cultivars  
in several countries. Huang et al. ( 1997) pyramided four resistance genes into IR-24  
background. The resistance gene Xa-1, conferring resistance to the Japanese Xoo race  
I, was first reported by Sakaguchi (Sakaguchi  1967). TheXa-1 gene was extensively  
studied and mapped to chromosome 4 by RFLP markers (Yoshimura et al.  1996).  
Positional cloning of the gene in the rice genome project in Japan revealed that it  
encodes a nucleotide-binding site leucine-rich repeat (NBS-LRR) type of protein. A  
broad spectrum bacterial blight resistance gene Xa-21 was introgressed from the wild  
species O. longistaminata into O. sativa background (Khush and Mackill  1989). This  
gene was tagged by RAPD and RFLP markers and was later cloned by map-based  
cloning strategy. Marker-assisted selection was used by Sanchez et al. (2000) to trans- 
fer three bacterial blight resistance genes Xa-5, Xa-13, and Xa-21 into three promising  
new plant types. The same set of genes were also pyramided into PR106, a widely  
grown variety in Punjab, India and Samba Mahsuri (BPT5204), a very popular variety  
with farmers and consumers across India because of its high yield and excellent cook- 
ing quality (Sundaram and Vishnupriya 2008; Singh et al. 2001). The Xa3/Xa26 fam- 
ily is a potential disease resistance gene reservoir. In addition to Xa3/Xa26, the MRKa,  
a paralog of Xa3/Xa26 in rice cultivar Minghui 63, can mediate Xoo resistance (Cao  
et al. 2007). Datta et al. (2002) stacked the Bt fusion gene (for insect resistance) and  
the chitinase gene (for tolerance of sheath blight) in rice by reciprocal crossing. 

Transgenic Research 

Maruthasalam  et  al.  (2007)  generated  indica  rice  cultivars,  co-transformed  with  
genes rice chitinase (chi11) and a thaumatin-like protein (tlp) conferring resistance  
to  fungal  pathogens,  and  a  serine-threonine  kinase  (Xa21)  conferring  bacterial  
blight resistance through particle bombardment. The transgenic Pusa Basmati1 line  
pyramided with chi11, tlp andXa21 showed an enhanced resistance to both sheath  
blight  and  bacterial  blight.  Zhai  et  al.  (2004,  2000)  transformed  Xa21  into  five  
widely used Chinese rice varieties through an Agrobacterium -mediated transforma- 
tion system and obtained transgenic plants highly resistant to bacterial blight  disease  
(Table 18.2).

18.4.2.2     Virus Resistance 

The detrimental effects of viruses in rice yield have posed a challenge in the past  
years. In fact, , 828,000 tons of rice amounting to US$120 million was lost due to  
rice grassy stunt virus (RGSV) or co-infection by RGSV and rice ragged stunt virus  
(RRSV) that severely infected more than 485,000 hectares of paddy fields in south- 
ern Vietnam  during  2006–2007  (Cabauatan  and  Cabunagan  2009;  Sasaya  et  al.  
2013). Thus, it is important to control viral diseases in rice to maintain global food  
security and rice supply. 

Marker-Assisted Breeding 

Some indica paddy varieties, such as Modan, have a resistance allele Stvb-i, which  
is incompletely dominant and allelic with Stv-b on chromosome 11 (Washio et al.  
1968). In the 1960s, Stvb-i from Modan was introduced into many japonica variet- 
ies, including St. No. 1, Chugoku 31, Aichi 6 and Aichi 97 for the control of rice  
stripe virus (RSV) (Toriyama et al. 1966; Maeda et al. 2006). Thereafter, the deriva- 
tive varieties harboring Stvb-i were widely cultivated in Japan and in the Jiangsu  
province of China with stable resistance to RSV (Wang 2006). 
   In the variety Milyang 23, a QTL for RSV resistance was detected in the interval  
between markers XNpb202 and C1172 on chromosome 11 (Maeda et al.  1999),  
which was reported to be allelic with Stvb-i. Subsequently, the same research group  
using both RFLP and SSR markers reported two QTLs in the Japanese upland rice  
variety, Kanto 72. The QTL on chromosome 11 corresponding to Stv-b exerted a  
greater effect than the other on chromosome 2 by reducing the infection rate of RSV  
(Maeda et al. 2006, 2004). Ding et al. (2004) also detected two major QTLs for RSV  
resistance in the  indica variety, DV85 (Table  18.1). One was mapped to the same  
chromosomal region as Stvb-i and the other was mapped on chromosome 7. More  
recently, three QTLs were detected in the Indian landrace Dular, one on chromo- 
some 3 and the other two in the RM287–RM209 and RM209–RM21 intervals on  
chromosome 11, respectively (Wu et al. 2009).Romero et al. (2014) identified one  
major QTL on the short arm of chromosome 4 for resistance to rice hoja blanca  
virus (RHBV) in two populations. Two major QTL on chromosomes 5 and 7 were  
also identified for resistance to  T. orizicolus in the Fd2000 · WC366 and Fd50 ·  
WC366 crosses, respectively. This comparative study using two distinct rice popu- 
lations allowed for a better understanding of how the resistance to RHBV and its  
vector are controlled genetically. Zhang et al. (2011) performed QTL analysis for  
RSV resistance using 98 backcross inbred lines derived from the cross between the  
highly resistant variety, Kasalath and the highly susceptible variety, Nipponbare.  
Under artificial inoculation in the greenhouse, two QTLs for RSV resistance, desig- 
nated qSTV7 and qSTV11KAS, were detected on chromosomes 7 and 11 respec- 
tively, whereas only one QTL was detected in the same location of chromosome 11  
under natural inoculation in the field. The stability of qSTV11KAS was validated  
using 39 established chromosome segment substitution lines (CSSLs). Fine  mapping

of qSTV11KAS was carried out using 372 BC3F2:3 recombinants and 399 BC3F3:4  
lines selected from 7018 BC3F2. Resistance to RSV has been studied in Japanese  
upland rice varieties and two loci, Stv-a and Stv-b, have been reported (Washio et al.  
1968). Stv-a and Stv-b are complementary dominant genes. The former was linked  
with the glutinous endosperm (wx) and photosensitivity-1 (Se-1) loci on chromo- 
some 6 and the latter was located on chromosome 11. Encabo et al. (2009) devel- 
oped near-isogenic lines from Utri Merah and Taichung Native 1 (TN1), which were  
evaluated for reactions to rice tungro spherical virus (RTSV) and rice tungro bacil- 
liform virus (RTBV). TW16 is an NIL (BC5) resistant to rice tungro disease (RTD).  
RTBV was able to infect both TN1 and TW16 but the levels of RTBV were usually  
significantly lower in TW16 than in TN1. Infection of RTSV was confirmed in TN1  
by a serological test but not in TW16. However, the global gene-expression pattern  
in an RTSV-resistant NIL (BC6), TW16-69, inoculated with RTSV indicated that  
RTSV can also infect the resistant NIL. Infection of RTSV in TW16 was later con- 
firmed by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) but the level of  
RTSV was considerably lower in TW16 than in TN1. Examination for virus accu- 
mulation in another NIL (BC6), TW16-1029, indicated that all plants of TW16- 
1029 were resistant to RTSV, whereas the resistance to RTBV and symptom severity  
were segregating among the individual plants of TW16-1029. Collectively, these  
results suggest that RTD resistance of Utri Merah involves suppression of interact- 
ing RTSV and RTBV but the suppression trait for RTSV and for RTBV is inherited  
separately. 

Transgenic Research 

Transformation of rice with the RHBV nucleocapsid protein (N) gene showed a  
significant  reduction  in  disease  development  (Lentini  et  al.  2003)  (Table  18.2).  
Reactions were observed that ranged from susceptible to completely resistant plants  
(immunity). The resistant reactions were characterized by the production of local  
lesions like a hypersensitive reaction or a recovery phenotype with the emergence  
of symptomless new leaves. These transgenic RHBV-resistant rice lines expressed  
the N gene RNA at low levels that were below the detection limit by Northern blots  
and only resolved by RT-PCR. The nucleocapsid protein could not be detected in  
any of the transgenic plants either by Western or ELISA tests. These results suggest  
that the resistance encoded by the N gene in these plants appears to be mediated by  
RNA. When challenged with RHBV, the resistant transgenic lines showed a signifi- 
cant increased performance for important agronomic traits including the number of  
tillers, the number of grains per plant and the yield as compared to the susceptible  
control. Furthermore, upon inoculation some of the most resistant transgenic lines  
showed agronomic traits similar to the uninoculated, non-transgenic Cica 8 control.  
Using  both  agronomic  traits  and  disease  severity  as  criteria,  several  of  the  most  
resistant lines demonstrated that the N gene and RHBV resistance were inherited in  
a stable manner. These transgenic rice lines could become a new genetic resource in  
developing RHBV-resistant cultivars. Verma et al. (2012) transformed rice using

DNA constructs designed to express an untranslatable sense or anti-sense RTSV  
RNA.  Progeny  of  primary  transformants,  showing  low  copies  of  the  integrated  
transgenes and accumulating the corresponding transcripts at low levels, were chal- 
lenged with viruliferous green leafhopper (GLH). Three out of four transgenic plant  
lines expressing untranslatable RTSV RNA in the sense orientation and two out of  
the four lines expressing an RTSV gene in the anti-sense orientation showed delayed  
buildup of RTSV RNA over time. Transmission of RTBV from the above lines was  
reduced significantly. 
    Biotechnological  approaches  have  also  been  employed  to  develop  transgenic  
plants for resistance against RTBV and RTSV (Dai and Beachy  2009). Ganesan  
et al. (2009) transformed indica rice cultivar Pusa Basmati-1 with coat protein (CP)  
gene of an Indian isolate of RTBV. Rice plants containing the transgene integrated  
in low copy numbers were obtained, in which the CP was shown to accumulate in  
the leaf tissue. The progenies representing three independent transformation events  
were challenged with Indian isolates of RTBV using viruliferous GLH and the viral  
titers in the inoculated plants were monitored using DNA dot-blot hybridization. As  
compared to non-transgenic controls, two independent transgenic lines showed sig- 
nificantly low levels of RTBV DNA, especially towards later stages of infection and  
a concomitant reduction of tungro symptoms. The transgenic strategies for RTD  
resistance are promising although pathogen derived resistance for RTD has been  
reported as being only partially effective. Recently, some research on the develop- 
ment of transgenic resistance to RTD have been done targeting RTBV, as it is the  
causative agent of tungro symptoms (Ganesan et al.  2009; Dai et al. 2008; Tyagi  
et al.  2008). These reports showed considerable resistance against the disease in  
controlled laboratory conditions. Tyagi et al. (2008) developed a transgenic rice line  
by RNA interference (RNAi) for the control of RTBV infection. In the two trans- 
genic lines expressing ds-RNA, different resistance responses were observed against  
RTBV. In one of the above lines (RTBV-O-Ds1), there was an initial rapid buildup  
of RTBV levels following inoculation, comparable to that of untransformed con- 
trols, followed by a sharp reduction, resulting in approximately 50-fold lower viral  
titers, whereas the untransformed controls maintained high levels of the virus till 40  
days  post-inoculation  (dpi).  In  RTBV-ODs2,  RTBV  DNA  levels  gradually  rose  
from an initial low to almost 60 % levels of the control by 40 dpi. Line RTBV-  
O- Ds1  showed  symptoms  of  tungro  similar  to  the  untransformed  control  lines,  
whereas line RTBV-O-Ds2 showed extremely mild symptoms. 

18.4.3       Nematodes  

About 300 nematode species belonging to 35 genera have been reported infesting  
rice.  Among  them,  nematode  species  from  about  ten  genera  are  economically  
important in relation to rice production. Rice grown in different environments is  
attacked by different nematode species. Ufra (Ditylenchus angustus) and root-knot  
(Meloidogyne spp.) nematodes are major pests of deepwater rice. In irrigated rice,  

----------------------- Page 515-----------------------

516                                                                          A.K. Biswal et al. 

infections  by  Hirschmanniella  spp.  and  Aphelenchoides  besseyi  are  common,  
whereas upland rice is invariably infested by Meloidogyne and Pratylenchus spe- 
cies. Among  the  important  nematode  species  that  attack  rice,  ufra  and  white  tip  
nematodes find a place in regulatory pest lists of several countries (Varaprasad et al.  
2006). In India, yield losses due to ufra were reported as 5–50 % in UP (Singh  
1953), 10–15 % in West Bengal, and 30–100 % in hot spots for this nematode in  
Assam (Panwar and Rao  1998). In southern region of Thailand, 10–90 % loss was  
observed (Hashioka 1963). Khuong (1983) observed most severe and conspicuous  
damage  by  D.  angustus  in  50,000  ha  flooded  fields  with  50  %  yield  loss  in  the  
Mekong Delta and Dong-Thap Province of Vietnam. 
   Nematode  problems  have  received  relatively  less  attention  in  the  past  due  to  
incipient damage in vast areas and difficulties in investigations. Most of the times,  
the losses caused by the parasitic nematodes in rice are just accepted mainly due to  
unawareness, poor economic condition of the rice growers, and subsistence farming  
of the crop. However, importance of nematode pests has increased in the recent  
years due to the changes in cropping systems and introduction of new production  
technologies that favor nematode multiplication and spread to new ecosystems in  
several rice-growing countries. More than 200 species of plant-parasitic nematodes  
(PPNs) have been reported to be associated with rice (Prot  1994). Rice root-knot  
nematodes (Meloidogyne spp.), rice root nematode (Hirschmanniella oryzae), white  
tip nematode (Aphelenchoides besseyi), and stem nematode (Ditylenchus angustus)  
are the important PPNs associated with rice-based cropping systems (Sharma and  
Rahaman  1998). Among these, the rice root-knot nematodes (Meloidogyne sp.) are  
considered as the major problem in rainfed, upland, and lowland rice fields, whereas  
the  rice  root  nematodes  (Hirschmanniella  sp.)  are  problematic  on  lowland  rice-  
growing areas of South and Southeast Asia (Prot  1994). Among Meloidogyne sp.,  
the rice root-knot nematode (M. graminicola Golden and Birchfield) attacking rice  
and  wheat  is  considered  the  most  serious  nematode  in  upland  rice  cultivation  
(Panwar and Rao  1998) and causes economic losses in upland, lowland, and deep- 
water rice and also in rice nurseries (Bridge et al.  1990). 
   Rice root-knot nematode, M. graminicola, was reported to reproduce on all the  
ten wild Oryza species tested. O. australiensis Domin and O. brachyantha Chev and  
Rochr  showed  by  far  the  greatest  infestation  (5855  and  10,235  juveniles/g  root,  
respectively) compared with O. officinalis Wall., which recorded the lowest infesta- 
tion (240 juveniles/g root). O. latifolia Desv., O. ridleyi Hook. f., and O. rufipogon  
Griff. recorded <500 juveniles/g root (Gergon and Prot  1993). Efforts have been  
initiated to screen for rice cultivars with resistance to M. graminicola. Srivastava  
et al. (2011) identified Achhoo, HPR2373, and Naggardhan as rice cultivars with  
appreciable resistance to M. graminicola . In these cultivars only up to ten galls were  
observed per 5 g root sample in a 3-year consecutive field testing. In contrast, Ranbir  
Basmati and Hasan Sarai were found to be highly susceptible. These contrasting  
phenotypes would be helpful in breeding efforts as well as marker development for  
MAS-breeding approaches. There are other reports on screening for resistant rice  
cultivars (Ravindra et al. 2015; Sharma-Poudyal et al. 2004). However, due to dif- 
ferences in the screening procedures, it has become challenging to come up with a

list of truly M. graminicola-resistant rice cultivars. Pokharel et al. (2012) noted that  
the absence of a uniform resistance evaluation procedure has taken a toll on the  
progress of the development of resistant lines. 

18.4.3.1     Marker-Assisted Breeding 

M. graminicola does not show any significant effect on yield of indica rice variety  
Bala, but causes a yield reduction of almost half in japonica  rice variety Azucena,  
suggesting  that  the  partial  resistance  to  nematode  establishment  was  related  to  
 nematode tolerance. Shrestha et al. (2007) identified QTLs for partial resistance to  
M. graminicola using a mapping population based on Bala (tolerant) × Azucena  
(susceptible). A total of six putative QTLs for nematode tolerance were detected.  
For  two  of  the  QTLs  detected, Azucena  was  the  donor  of  the  tolerance  alleles,  
 suggesting  it  may  be  possible  to  breed  plants  with  greater  tolerance  than  Bala.  
Evaluation of advanced backcross populations developed for water stress environ- 
ment and M. graminicola resistance revealed that Teqing and the donors cvs Type 3,  
Zihui 100, and Shwe Thwe Yin Hyv were resistant to the nematode (Prasad and  
Vijayakumar   2006).   Furthermore,   the   study   revealed   that   the   resistance   to   
M. graminicola is most likely multigenic in nature. 
   While  Soriano  et  al.  ( 1999)  have  identified  resistant  wild  rice  accessions  of   
O. glaberrima (TOG7235, TOG5674, TOG5675) and  O. longistaminata (WL02),  
success of introgression into O. sativa has been very limited. Using the rice diver- 
sity panel 1 with 332 accessions, Dimkpa et al. (2016) found accessions Khao Pahk  
Maw and LD 24 to be resistant to M. graminicola and identified 11 QTLs through a  
genome-wide  association  study.  It  is  noteworthy  that  6  of  the  11  QTLs  contain  
genes annotated as containing lectin domains. QTL11.1 contains genes that have  
been  associated  with  powdery  mildew  resistance  in  barley  and  also  genes  with  
strong homology to stripe rust resistance (Dimkpa et al. 2016). Fine mapping these  
regions should yield molecular markers and perhaps mine new resistance genes for  
molecular breeding and/or the generation of resistant transgenic lines. 

18.4.3.2     Transgenic Research 

There are several possible approaches to develop transgenic plants with improved  
nematode  resistance,  such  as  anti-invasion  and  migration  strategies,  feeding-cell  
attenuation, and anti-nematode feeding and development strategies (Atkinson et al.  
2003). Plant proteins (cystatins) that prevent digestion of dietary plant proteins by  
the feeding nematodes have been exploited for rice nematode resistance. Expression  
of an engineered cysteine proteinase inhibitor (oryzacystatin-IΔD86) for nematode  
resistance in transgenic rice plants resulted in a significant (55 %) reduction in egg  
production  by  Meloidogyne  incognita  (Vain  et  al.  1998)  (Table  18.2).  However,  
more  research  is  required  to  understand  the  plant-nematode  interaction  and  to  
develop smart plants that can resist nematodes.

18.4.4       Insect Pest  

Among the biotic stresses, next to diseases, yield losses due to insect damages  
are considered as major cause for the decline in rice production and productivity  
worldwide. Losses due to pests and diseases have been estimated at 37 % of  
agricultural production worldwide, with 13 % due to only insect pests (Gatehouse  
1992). Yield  loss  due  to  insects  in  Asia  has  been  estimated  at  nearly  25  %  
(Heinrichs and Institute  1985). The losses due to egregious pests like stem bor- 
ers, gall midge, green leafhopper, rice hispa, brown leafhopper, and thrips are  
quite high (Kalode et al. 1986). Brown planthopper (BPH) is a destructive insect  
pest to rice in Asian countries. It directly damages the plant phloem by using its  
piercing-sucking  mouthparts,  resulting  in  “hopper  burn”  in  the  most  serious  
cases. It is also a vector for rice grassy stunt virus and ragged stunt virus, which  
cause further yield losses in many Asian countries (Zhang and Xie  2014). At  
least  six  species  of  stem  borer  attack  rice.  These  are  the  yellow  stem  borer,  
white  stem  borer,  striped  stem  borer,  gold-fringed  stem  borer,  dark-headed  
striped  stem  borer,  and  pink  stem  borer.  Stem  borers  can  destroy  rice  at  any  
stage of the plant from seedling to maturity. At the vegetative stage, the insect  
larva feeds inside the stem resulting in death of the young leaf whorl causing  
“deadheart,”  and  during  reproductive  stage,  it  feeds  inside  the  panicle  stalk  
leading  to  unfilled  grains  causing  “white  heads”  (Biswal  2010).  The  average  
yearly yield losses caused by above insects are estimated at about 10 million  
tons worldwide (Herdt  1991). Enhancing the host plant resistance is considered  
as  the  most  desirable  approach  to  combat  insect/pathogen  attack.  Hence  
improvement of rice cultivars by identification and incorporation of new resis- 
tance genes into modern rice cultivars are important breeding strategies to con- 
trol the damage caused by different insect pests. 

18.4.4.1      Marker-Assisted Selection 

Brown planthopper (BPH) is one of the major insect pests of rice in the temperate  
rice-growing regions. A resistant gene bph2 was successfully mapped between SSR  
markers  RM7102  and  RM463  on  the  long  arm  of  chromosome  12,  in  a  cross  
between resistant parent ASD7 and susceptible cultivar C418, a japonica restorer  
line (Sun et al. 2006). Three other QTLs for seedling resistance and feeding rate to  
BPH  were  identified  in  a  cross  between  Zhenshan  97  (ZS97)  and  IR65482-17  
(derived  from  the  wild  rice  species  Oryza  australiensis)  (Hu  et  al.  2015).  Other  
derivatives of O. australiensis were also used to identify QTLs and the genes Bph10  
and Bph18(t) (Jena et al. 2006; Nguyen Thi Lang 2003). Three other QTLs control- 
ling BPH resistance were detected on chromosomes 2, 10, and 12 in a cross between  
Nipponbare (japonica) x Kasalath (indica) where all of the resistance QTLs came  
from Kasalath, the moderate resistance parent (Su et al.  2002). Du et al. (2009)  
cloned   Bph14       gene    which     encodes     a   coiled-coil,    nucleotide-binding,        and

leucine- rich  repeat  (CC-NB-LRR)  protein.  QTLs  associated  with  resistance  to  
white-backed planthopper (WBPH) (Sogatella furcifera) have been identified using  
a doubled- haploid (DH) mapping population derived from the cross IR64/Azucena  
in rice (Geethanjali et al. 2009). QTLs associated with sucking pests have also been  
identified in a RIL population derived from a cross between japonica rice variety  
Kinmaze and indica DV85 (Wang et al. 2004). Screening of a F  population derived 2 
from a cross between an introgression line, IR71033-121-15, from O. minuta, and a  
susceptible Korean japonica cultivar, Junambyeo, resulted in identification of two  
major QTLs for BPH resistance. 
   Attempts  have  been  made  to  identify  rice  germplasm  with  resistance  to  stem  
borer. ANOVA and linear regression involving the SSR marker data and the pheno- 
typic data associated with YSB resistance resulted in the association of SSR marker  
RM104 on chromosome 1 with deadheart incidence under both glass house and  
field conditions (Palanivel et al. 2014). 

18.4.4.2     Transgenic Approach 

Conventional efforts have been made for the development of rice varieties with  
moderate level of resistance to stem borer for two decades (Kalode et al.  1986).  
The results were not convincing. The identification of donor varieties with high  
level  of  resistance  still  remains  a  challenge  for  breeders.  Even  the  effort  of  
screening more than 30,000 rice accessions for the stem borer resistance genes  
was not successful in identifying sufficient degree of resistance in any of the  
accessions (Teng  1995). However, great progress has been made in developing  
insect-resistant rice by the transformation of Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) genes  
(Table  18.2). Numerous independent transgenic events have been generated by  
using different genes and combination of genes or genes and promoters (Biswal  
2010;  Fujimoto  and  Itoh  1993;  Ju  et  al.  1998;  Loc  and  Tinjuangjun  2002;  
Ramesh et al.  2004; Tang et al. 2006; Jouanin and Bonadé-Bottino  1998; Xu  
et al. 1996). Transgenic elite rice lines expressing a Bt fusion gene derived from  
cryIA(b)  and  cryIA(c)  under  the  control  of  rice  actinI  promoter  showed  high  
protection against two lepidopteran insects, leaf folder and yellow stem borer,  
without  reduction  in  yield  (Tu  et  al.  2000).  Similarly,  many  other  lines  have  
been field tested with positive results (Tang et al. 2006; Ye et al. 2001; Shu et al.  
2000; Bashir et al. 2004; Chen et al. 2005; Ye et al. 2003; Oard et al. 1996). In  
October 2009, the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture issued biosafety certificates  
for  commercial  production  of  two  cry1Ab/Ac  (Bt)  lines  (Chen  et  al.  2011).  
Rigorous testing has shown that these transgenic rice lines are safe for the envi- 
ronment and also for use as food. Laboratory and field tests have confirmed that  
these two Bt rice lines can provide effective and economic control of the lepi- 
dopteran complex on rice with less risk to the environment than present prac- 
tices (Chen et al.  2011). Field evaluation of Bt rice is under progress in many  
other countries which may result in release of transgenic rice in other countries  
shortly.

18.5       Boosting the Rice Yield 

Since the beginning of cereal cultivation, there has been a continuous challenge to  
increase grain yield. The green revolution almost doubled the rice production that  
sustained the simultaneous increase in global population from 3 billion in 1961 to 7  
billion within five decades. In today’s rapidly increasing population that is expected  
to reach 9.1 billion by the year 2050 (Fao 2009), the demand for rice simultaneously  
increases  as  well.  Therefore,  considerable  efforts  are  now  being  undertaken  to  
develop strategies in boosting rice yields. These strategies include the elucidation  
and  engineering  of  the  traits  that  govern  rice  yield,  herbicide  tolerance,  and  C  4 
photosynthesis. 

18.5.1       Yield Traits 

Yield is one of the most important and complex traits in the genetic improvement of  
rice. Over the past years, tremendous efforts have been done in functional genomics  
research in rice. Cloning and functional characterization of genes that may be asso- 
ciated to or directly related to yield traits have led to considerable progress in the  
understanding of molecular and biological processes underlying yield traits in rice. 
    Rice varieties differ greatly in their grain yield. This variability is influenced by  
their vast genetic diversity, environmental conditions, field management practices,  
and the interactions between genotypes and environment that confer adaptation to a  
specific environmental condition. As a complex trait, grain yield of a rice plant is  
determined by three component traits: number of tillers/panicles per plant, number  
of grains per panicle, and grain weight. In the recent years, advances in the  molecular  
marker, genome mapping, and quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis technologies  
have greatly facilitated the studies on the genetic bases of these quantitative traits. 

18.5.1.1     Number of Tillers/Panicles per Plant 

The first of the three component traits that is significant to the improvement of rice  
grain yield is the number of tillers/panicles. Rice panicles arise from the fully devel- 
oped tillers. Rice tillers are produced at the late vegetative phase of rice growth and  
develop through the process of shoot branching. Axillary meristems are formed in  
each leaf axil which subsequently generates a few lateral leaves to form the axillary  
bud. Axillary buds may be subsequently activated to form shoot branches called til- 
lers. Secondary and higher-ordered tiller arise through subsequent development if  
environmental conditions permit. Once fully developed, tillers will give rise to the  
development of panicles and the subsequent development of grains after pollination.  
The  activity  of  the  axillary  buds  is  mediated  by  a  network  of  systemic  signals  
through the complex interactions of phytohormones. The production and signaling

18   Role of Biotechnology in Rice Production                                               521 

via phytohormones are influenced by genetic, developmental, and environmental  
signals (Leyser 2003; Shimizu-Sato and Mori 2001; Xing and Zhang 2010). These  
phytohormones which include that of auxins (Aux), cytokinins (CKs), and strigo- 
lactones and its derivatives allow for the integration of information between differ- 
ent plant organs necessary for plant development (Domagalska and Leyser 2011). A  
well-known concept in apical dominance had shown the role of CK and Aux in the  
regulation  of  shoot  apical  meristem  in  rice  (Azizi  et  al.  2015).  CKs  have  been  
observed to promote branching, leading to an increase in the numbers of spikelet in  
rice, while Aux, provided by the primary shoot apex, suppresses axillary bud growth  
(Xing and Zhang 2010; Azizi et al. 2015). CK reduces the inhibition and leads to the  
outgrowth of lateral branches, and the decreased level of CK results in the increase  
of apical dominance and repression of axillary bud growth (Azizi et al. 2015). 
    Grain yield is predominantly contributed by the primary tillers and some second- 
ary  tillers.  Tertiary  and  higher-ordered  tillers  usually  make  little  contribution  to  
grain yield despite its consumption of water, nutrients, and photosynthetic products  
(Mohanan and Mini 2008). Thus, breeding strategies for the development of rice  
varieties with optimum numbers of primary and secondary tillers should be a prior- 
ity. From an agronomic point of view, it is suggested that strategies to regulate axil- 
lary   bud   activity   through   biotechnology   and   genetic   engineering   would   be  
advantageous in the effort to increase rice yields (Xing and Zhang 2010). 

Marker-Assisted Breeding 

In the recent years, several major QTLs have been identified to influence the number  
of panicles (Table  18.1). In a cross between Junambyeo and an introgressed indica  
IR71033-121-15, two QTLs affecting the number of panicles on chromosomes 4  
and 6 in both populations were identified and designated as pn4 and pn6 , respec- 
tively (Rahman et al. 2008). It was found in the same study that an increasing effect  
on chromosome 4 was imparted by IR71033; on the other hand, there was a decreas- 
ing effect on chromosome 6. In addition, a recent genome-wide association study  
(GWAS) has employed three multi-parent advanced generation intercross (MAGIC)  
populations from elite  indica lines (DC1, DC2, and 8 way) to identify QTLs for  
several yield traits and has revealed a QTL for panicle number designated as qPN2  
(Meng et al. 2016). 

Transgenic Research 

Some phytohormones also influence tillering and branching, and several genes act- 
ing downstream of these phytohormones have been identified. One of these is the  
rice  OsTB1  (Oryza  sativa  Teosinte  Branched  1).  OsTB1  encodes  for  a  putative  
transcription  factor  carrying  a  helix-loop-helix  DNA-binding  motif,  and  it  was  
found to be a negative regulator of lateral branching in rice (Takeda et al. 2003). In  
a   recent    study,    this   gene    had    been     overexpressed      in   rice   through  

----------------------- Page 521-----------------------

522                                                                          A.K. Biswal et al. 

Agrobacterium -mediated  transformation,  and  it  was  observed  that  compared  to  
wild-type plants, the number of tillers and panicles was reduced and increased in  
overexpressed  and  RNAi- mediated  knockdown  OsTB1  rice  plants,  respectively  
(Choi et al. 2012) (Table  18.2). 
    Additionally, microRNAs (miRNAs) have been shown to play a vital role in the  
regulation of plant development by targeting complementary RNAs for cleavage or  
translational  repression  (Jones-Rhoades  et  al.  2006).  Recent  studies  showed  that  
miRNAs were involved in rice tillering and the number of panicles by regulating a  
number  of  target  genes.  In  fact,  transgenic  rice  overexpressing  an  miRNA,  
OsmiR393, displayed a 30 % increase in the number of tillers compared to the con- 
trol plants (Xia et al. 2012). This was attributed to the hyposensitivity to auxin sig- 
nals  of  auxin  receptor  gene  homologs  (OsTIR1  and  OsAFB2)  targeted  by  the  
OsmiR393. In addition, the increase in tillering was also owed to the downregula- 
tion of expression of the auxin transporter OsAUX1 and OsTB1. In a similar study,  
it was reported that the overexpression of the  OsmiR397 miRNA in rice promotes  
panicle branching, leading to an increase in overall grain yield of up to 25 % in a  
field trial (Zhang et al. 2013). In summary, all of these suggest that manipulation of  
these regulatory genes may prove to be useful in achieving the optimum number of  
panicles/tillers in an effort to increase rice yield. 

18.5.1.2     Number of Grains per Panicle 

The number of grains per panicle is a complex quantitative trait in rice and is one of  
the most important component traits for rice yield. Furthermore, it has been posi- 
tively correlated with grain yield per plant (Khan et al. 2009) highlighting its signifi- 
cance in the improvement of rice yield potential (Table 18.1). The number of grains  
per panicle is divided into three subcomponent traits: panicle development, rate of  
spikelet formation, and duration of panicle differentiation (Tripathi et al. 2012). 
    Panicle  development  marks  the  transition  from  the  late  vegetative  phase  to  
reproductive phase and is influenced by an interplay of phytohormones and a num- 
ber of genetic factors. Mutant analyses have revealed two main regulatory genes of  
axillary meristem formation in rice. These include the LAX PANICLE1 (Lax1) and  
SMALL PANICLE (SPA) genes (Komatsu et al. 2003). Lax1 and SPA were dem- 
onstrated to play an overlapping function in axillary meristematic formation, which  
is significant in the transition from vegetative phase to reproductive phase. In Lax1  
mutants, indeterminate growth of rachis branches and a constrained initiation and/ 
or  maintenance  of  lateral  and  terminal  spikelets  have  been  observed  (Komatsu  
et  al.  2001).  Molecular  cloning  and  sequence  analysis  of  Lax1  revealed  that  it  
encodes for a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor involved in the  
formation of all types of axillary meristems throughout the ontogeny of a rice plant  
(Komatsu et al. 2003). 
    Genes associated with the control of the rate of spikelet formation include DEP1  
(Huang et al.  2009), SP1 (Li et al.  2009), APO1 (Ikeda-Kawakatsu et al.  2009),  
LOG  (Kurakawa  et  al.  2007),  and  cytokinin  degradation  enzyme  (OsCKX2)  

----------------------- Page 522-----------------------

18   Role of Biotechnology in Rice Production                                              523 

(Ashikari et al. 2008). All are known to be positive regulators of the rate of spikelet  
formation except OsCKX2. Among these, DEP1 was highly expressed from the til- 
lering to the heading stage, while the expression of SP1 was higher until the flower- 
ing  stage  (Tripathi  et  al.  2012).  On  the  other  hand,  the  expression  of  OsCKXR  
encoded by the Gn1a gene was found to have a negative correlation with the grain  
yield per plant. This supports the positive influence of CKs on the grain number per  
plant. The decreased expression of OsCKX2 thus leads to an increase in the number  
of reproductive organs and spikelets due to the accumulation of CK in the inflores- 
cence meristems. This, in turn, leads to an improvement in the grain yield (Azizi  
et al. 2015; Ashikari et al. 2008). 

Marker-Assisted Breeding 

The duration of panicle differentiation is influenced by QTLs that control heading  
date. Gene/QTLs that regulate heading date usually increase the duration of panicle  
differentiation to increase spikelet number per panicle and, in turn, enhance grain  
yield potential (Tripathi et al. 2012). Among these are the Ghd7 (Weng et al. 2014;  
Xue et al. 2008), Ghd8/DTH8 (Wei et al. 2010; Yan et al. 2011), RCN1 (Nakagawa  
et al. 2002), and RFL (Kyozuka et al.  1998; Rao et al. 2008). Ghd7 encodes for a  
CCT motif family of protein and functions as one of the major regulators in the  
pleiotropic  control  of  several  traits,  including  the  number  of  grains  per  panicle,  
plant height, and heading date (hence the name Ghd). A recent study has suggested  
that Ghd7 positively regulates both tiller and panicle branches in a density-depen- 
dent manner, indicating that Ghd7 influences the control of branch development in  
response to environmental conditions (Weng et al. 2014). In addition, elevated Ghd7  
expression levels repress Hd3a expression which prolongs panicle differentiation.  
Ghd7-1, Ghd7-3, and other Ghd7 functional alleles with strong effects allow rice to  
utilize light and temperature by delaying flowering under long- day conditions in  
areas with long growing seasons, thus producing large panicles and increasing grain  
yield  (Xue  et  al.  2008).  In  a  similar  fashion,  Ghd8/DTH8  is  able  to  repress  the  
expression  of  early  heading  date  1  (Ehd1)  and  Hd3a  under  long- day  conditions  
leading to a delayed heading date and an increased number of grains per plant (Wei  
et al. 2010; Yan et al. 2011). 

Transgenic Approach 

Several studies have employed transgenic approach in the functional characteriza- 
tion of some genes that may influence the number of grains per panicle. The LRK1  
(leucine-rich  repeat  receptor-like  kinase  1)  has  been  reported  to  contribute  to  a  
higher grain number per plant (Zha et al.  2009). The overexpression of this gene  
resulted in an increased number of panicles, spikelets per panicle, weight per grain,  
and cellular proliferation that led to a 27.09 % increase in total grain yield per plant.  
In another transgenic study in rice, the use of transgenic expression of a dominant

negative  form  of  SRK  (S-domain  receptor  kinase)  called  OsLSK1  (large  spike  
S-domain receptor-like kinase 1) was observed to improve grain yield components  
in rice (Zou et al. 2015a). In the same study, the overexpression of a truncated ver- 
sion of OsLSK1 improved the primary branches per panicle and grains per primary  
branch which resulted to an increase in grain number per panicle in OXOsLSK1-t-3  
and OXOsLSK1-t-4 transgenic lines generated (Zou et al. 2015b). Additionally, in a  
study on another gene OsSPL14 (squamosa promoter-binding protein-like 14, also  
known as IPA1) encoded by the WFP (wealthy farmer’s panicle), QTL has been  
reported to increase grain productivity in rice (Miura et al. 2010). It was observed  
that OsSPL14WFP allele on chromosome 8 was associated with an increase of about  

40 % in the primary branch and grain number. These studies underscore that the  
manipulation of these genes may be a viable and practicable way to improve grain  
yield in rice and other crops. 

18.5.1.3     Grain Weight 

Grain weight is a significant trait related to grain yield potential and grain quality of  
rice. Three parameters are commonly used to determine grain weight. These include  
grain length, grain width, and grain filling. Recent studies in QTL mapping and  
cloning have made significant progresses on identification of genes and major QTLs  
regulating grain weight (Table  18.1). The major genes/QTLs reported to regulate  
these parameters are GW2, GS3, and the grain incomplete filling 1 (GIF1) (Tripathi  
et al. 2012). 
   GW2 encodes a RING-type ubiquitin E3 ligase that was previously suggested  
to negatively regulate grain width and cell division by targeting its substrates to  
degradation via ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (Song et al.  2007). On the other  
hand, GS3 was found to influence grain size and length. The activity of GS3 to  
influence  grain  size  has  been  detected  in  a  diverse  range  of  rice  varieties  (Fan  
et al. 2009; Takano-Kai et al. 2009) and was found to have lower expression levels  
throughout the stages of development (Tripathi et al. 2012). Comparative sequence  
analysis  of  the  gene  has  identified  a  nonsense  mutation,  shared  among  all  the  
large-grain varieties sequenced in comparison with the small- to medium-grain  
varieties (Xing and Zhang 2010; Takano-Kai et al. 2009). This mutation causes a  
178-amino acid truncation in the C terminus of the protein product itself, suggest- 
ing that GS3 may function as a negative regulator for cell division and integument  
elongation. 
   GIF1  gene  was  observed  to  influence  grain  filling.  It  encodes  for  a  cell  wall  
invertase  required  for  carbon  partitioning  during  early  grain  filling  (Wang  et  al.  
2008). In contrast to the GW2 and GS3 genes, GIF1 functions as a positive regulator  
and had higher expression in the flowering and milk stages of the reproductive phase  
(Tripathi et al. 2012). 
   All of these highlight the role of biotechnology in increasing rice yield potential.  
Knowledge and control of these agronomically important genes that regulate major  
yield traits offer strategies in an effort to boost rice yields.

18.5.2       Herbicide Tolerance  

Herbicide tolerance (HT) is a significant agronomic trait that has been used to control  
weeds efficiently for several decades. Considerable efforts have been made to pro- 
duce HT crops to simplify weed management and to alleviate problems that arise  
from herbicide residues. Several techniques have been used to develop HT crops  
which include cell culture, in vitro selection, and genetic engineering approaches.  
Substantial efforts are being made to develop herbicide-tolerant rice using genes that  
confer resistance to herbicides. Three major HT systems, currently commercialized,  
are  based  on  resistance  to  herbicides  inhibiting  amino  acid  biosynthesis.  These  
include imidazolinone (IMI), glyphosate, and glufosinate resistance (Duke 2005). In  
rice, all the three HT rice systems have been developed (Scarabel et al. 2012; Tsai  
et al. 2006; Wang et al. 2014c). 
    IMI-resistant rice conveys resistance to the imidazolinone group of potent herbi- 
cides (imazethapyr, imazapyr, imazamox, imazapic), which control a broad spec- 
trum of grass and weeds and have favorable environmental profiles (Tan et al. 2005).  
Imidazolinone  herbicides  control  weeds  by  inhibiting  the  acetolactate  synthase  
(ALS) enzyme. As such, ALS has been the target for conventional mutation breed- 
ing  and  transgenic  protocols.  One  of  the  herbicides  that  inhibit ALS  activity  is  
bispyribac sodium (BS). BS tolerance was found to be associated with two point  
mutations in the ALS gene: a tryptophan-to-leucine change (W548 L) and another  
serine to isoleucine (S627I) (Endo et al. 2007). In the same study, a highly efficient  
T-DNA-mediated gene-targeting (GT) system was developed to introduce W548 L  
and S627I mutations into the ALS gene which resulted in the generation of hyper-  
tolerant rice plants against BS. 
    Transgenic approach has also been used to introduce herbicide-resistant genes  
into rice from other organisms. It includes the bar gene, isolated from Streptomyces  
hygroscopicus, responsible for the metabolic detoxification of glufosinates and the  
enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate               synthase      (EPSPS)        gene     isolated     from  
Agrobacterium strain CP4 that detoxifies glyphosate herbicides (Kumar et al. 2008).  
Considerable efforts have been made to find other sources of genes that could be  
used to develop HR transgenic rice. For example, transgenic rice plants expressing  
Bacillus subtilis protoporphyrinogen oxidase (an enzyme that is vital to heme and  
chlorophyll biosynthesis) were found to be resistant against the herbicide oxyfluor- 
fen (Jung et al.  2004). Another example is the expression of human cytochrome  
P450s in rice. Transgenic rice plants that contain CYP1A1, CYP2B6, and CYP2C19  
genes  were  found  to  be  more  tolerant  to  several  herbicides  than  non-transgenic  
plants (Kawahigashi et al. 2007; Kumar et al. 2012). However, rice plant expressing  
human genes may have ethical issues (Kumar et al. 2008). 
    Furthermore, herbicide resistance by metabolic detoxification can confer phy- 
toremediating capabilities to transgenic plants which can mitigate the debilitating  
effects of chemical residues in the environment. However, these advantages should  
be  weighed  against  potential  risks  and  consequences  that  are  brought  about  by  
large-scale adoption of HR technologies in rice.

18.5.3       Other Value-Added Traits 

18.5.3.1     Lodging Resistance 

High-yielding  varieties  with  natural  plant  height  generally  suffer  from  lodging  
though dwarf plants have relatively less lodging problem. In addition to plant height,  
lodging  resistance  also  depends  on  the  physical  strength  of  culms  (Ookawa  and  
Ishihara  1993). Recent development of the disomic derivatives of Oryza latifolia in  
the  background  of  O.  sativa  has  shown  high  culm  strength,  and  these  are  being  
considered as lines with potential to improve lodging resistance in cultivated rice  
stem (Angeles-Shim et al. 2014). 

18.5.4       C4 Rice

C4 photosynthesis is one of the most remarkable adaptations within the flowering  
plants. In fact, C4 photosynthesis is estimated to account for 20–30 % of terrestrial  
carbon fixation despite being used by only approximately 3 % of the total angio- 
sperm species (Kellogg 2013). The maximum energy conversion efficiency of C4  
photosynthesis mainly depends upon its CO  concentration mechanism in contrast 2 
to  the  common  C3  photosynthesis  systems  of  the  most  of  the  terrestrial  plants  
including rice. 
   In all plants, CO  is fixed by the enzyme ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxyl-2 
ase/oxygenase or Rubisco. It catalyzes the carboxylation of ribulose-1,5-bisphos- 
phate (RuBP) into an unstable 6-carbon intermediate that is subsequently hydrated  
and cleaved to produce two molecules of a three-carbon compound, 3-phospho- 
glycerate (3-PGA), as the first stable product (hence the name C3). In C3 plants,  
this process occurs in the mesophyll (M) cells located on the surface of the leaf.  
The deviant interaction of Rubisco with oxygen elicits Rubisco’s oxygenase activ- 
ity, in which O  is covalently bound to RuBP at carbon 2, producing a molecule of 2 
3-PGA and 2-phosphoglycolate (2-PG). 2-PG is toxic for the plant at higher con- 
centrations and has to undergo detoxification in the peroxisome and mitochondria  
in a process called photorespiration. In the photorespiratory cycle, 2-PG is regen- 
erated to 3-PGA. However, it involves the release of formerly assimilated CO  and 2 
NH , consumption of energy and reducing equivalents (Peterhansel et al. 2010), 3 
and,  consequently,  a  reduction  of  photosynthetic  efficiency  by  up  to  30  %  
(Mallmann  et  al.  2014).  For  this  reason,  photorespiration  is  often  viewed  as  a  
wasteful process. In C4 plants, the CO  is initially fixed by the cytosolic enzyme 2 
phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) to form a four-carbon compound oxa- 
loacetate (OAA) (hence the name C ). The PEPC is insensitive to O  and specifi-4 2 
cally reacts with only CO . Several attempts have been made either to understand 2 
the molecular mechanism of C4 photosynthesis or to introduce C4 photosynthesis  
into rice.

18.5.4.1     Marker-Assisted Breeding 

In  fact,  C4  photosynthesis  has  been  proposed  as  a  polygenic  quantitative  trait  
(Westhoff & Gowik 2010) because of stepwise transition from C3 to C4 and the  
presence of C3–C4 intermediates (Westhoff and Gowik 2010). Attempts have been  
made to map the QTL between closely related species from the 1970s. In one of the  
early crosses made by Malcolm Nobs and Olle Björkman between Atriplex prostrata  
(C3) and Atriplex rosea (C4), an F2 population was generated which showed segre- 
gation of individual C4. It could not proceed further due to aneuploidy. Similarly  
crosses  have  been  made  between  C3,  C4,  and  C3–C4  intermediates  of  Flaveria  
species through genetic engineering efforts. 

18.5.4.2     Transgenic Research 

Initially, it was thought that a single-cell C4 system could be faster to develop in C3  
plants, and there have been previous attempts to engineer single-cell C4 system in  
rice (Miyao et al.  2011). However, the earlier attempts have only produced futile  
cycle (Zhu et al. 2010). In an effort to incorporate the more efficient Kranz-type C4  
system into rice, the C4 rice consortium spearheaded the discovery of genes and  
engineering  of  already  known  genes  into  rice.  C4  genes  including  CA,  PEPC,  
PPDK, NADP-ME, and NADP-MDH have been cloned from maize and transformed  
into rice (Kajala et al. 2011). Several studies have employed comparative transcrip- 
tomics in maize and several closely related C3, C4, and C3–C4 intermediate species  
(Wang et al. 2013; Gowik et al. 2011; Wang and Czedik-Eysenberg 2014) to iden- 
tify candidate genes related to C4 syndrome and Kranz anatomy. Cohorts of genes  
have been identified and being validated through genetic transformation into rice  
(Table 18.2). 
   Currently, the phase III of the C4 Rice Project is underway. This will allow for a  
more refined genetic toolkit that has been assembled in the previous stages and a  
greater understanding of the regulatory mechanisms that establish the pathway in  
C4 plants. These efforts are geared toward the full realization of engineering the C4  
pathway into rice. 

18.6      Limitation of Molecular Breeding 

Main problems encountered in these studies were that the QTLs having a minor  
effect on the phenotype pose a great challenge for the breeders to select improved  
lines in the field condition and discovery of major QTLs functioning independent of  
their genetic background underlies extensive efforts (Gowda et al. 2011). Secondly,  
most of these QTL mapping studies in rice have been conducted using progenies  
derived from intraspecific crosses. Much needed efforts are still required to go for  
interspecific crosses to explore novel alleles and with their effective incorporation

into  the  breeding  programs  for  drought  tolerance  in  rice. Thirdly,  availability  of  
uniformly distributed molecular markers for fine mapping of large-effect QTLs has  
never been sufficient. Exploitation of 3 K genome sequence and the use of high-  
density  SNP  genotyping  platform  along  with  next-generation  sequencing  (NGS)  
may help to accelerate molecular breeding for improved rice cultivars. 

18.7      Controversies Over GM Rice 

Several controversies regarding the possible repercussions that genetically modified  
(GM) rice may bring have been raised. Though many of these are fictitious, some of  
these issues concern about its environmental and ecological safety, food safety, and  
ethical and economic issues, among others. 
    On an environmental and ecological perspective, the evolution of resistant pests  
and  weeds  termed  as  superbugs  and  super  weeds  raises  an  issue  on  the  conse- 
quences of GM rice (Bawa and Anilakumar 2013). This is based on the uncertainty  
of whether the pest-resistant characteristic of these transgenic crops can escape to  
their weedy relatives causing resistant and increased weeds. Similarly, herbicide-  
resistant transgenic crops are also speculated to cause the surrounding weeds to  
develop resistance as well, thus nullifying the effects of the transgenics. This has  
led to the topics regarding prevention of gene flow from transgenic crops to wild  
type. In a study conducted to assess gene flow from herbicide-resistant rice to that  
of the wild type, it was found that gene flow frequency decreased exponentially  
with increasing isolation distance and is dependent on the main wind direction dur- 
ing flowering (Han et al. 2015). These highlight the importance of crop manage- 
ment and agricultural laws if large-scale adoption of transgenic varieties is to be  
carried out. 
   Another major concern of GM crops, such as rice, is in its safety for human  
health. Health risks associated with GM foods are concerned with toxins and aller- 
gens (Bajaj and Mohanty  2005). Transgenic rice has been developed to overex- 
press 2S albumin from sesame to increase its cysteine and methionine content (Lee  
et al. 2003). Despite the fact that sesame has been used as a food additive in many  
Asian countries, the 2S albumin from sesame seeds has been previously demon- 
strated to be allergenic (Pastorello et al. 2001). While it is justifiable to conduct  
allergenicity  studies  on  all  transgenic  rice,  like  all  other  allergenic  food  items,  
allergenic transgenic products can be separately labeled and barred from people  
who are sensitive to it. 
   Rice is a staple food and is the primary source of energy for more than half of the  
world’s population. There is still a great amount of uncertainties, especially in the  
large-scale adoption of GM rice. Thus, it is understandable that the incorporation of  
GM rice into agricultural production is continuously being debated. All of these  
show the significance of weighing the immense potential benefits of GM rice in  
food supply and the possible risks that it entails.

    Nevertheless, genetic engineering has already shown the potential of plant bio- 
technology for crop improvement. As a result, transgenic plants with high agro- 
nomic and environmental value have been developed for several crop species such  
as maize, soybean, cotton, tomato, potato, tobacco, papaya, and wheat (http://www. 
isaaa.org/).  However,  it  suffers  from  onerous  regulatory  obstacles.  Nevertheless,  
new  methods  of  precisely  transferring  genes  through  targeted  genome  editing  
method may simplify the process of commercialization of transgenic crops with less  
severe  regulations.  Similarly  transfer  of  genes  from  the  same  or  related  species  
through cisgenic approach can also be exploited though it limits the potential of  
genetic engineering to deliver genetic material from any species. 

18.8       Future Research and Conclusions 

There  is  a  broad  scope  of  biotechnology  in  modern-day  agriculture. Apart  from  
genetic understanding of important traits, biotechnology has a key role in product  
development.  Marker-assisted  breeding  and  transgenic  deployment  are  the  two  
potential  areas.  Marker-assisted  rice  breeding  has  made  remarkable  progress.  
Varieties improved through MAS can be used to study gene function and resistance  
mechanisms by using modern biotechnological tools. The application of tissue cul- 
ture technology, as a central tool or as an adjunct to other methods, including recom- 
binant DNA techniques, is at the vanguard in plant modification and improvement  
for agriculture, horticulture, and forestry. Implementation of targeted genome edit- 
ing technologies such as TALENs and CRISPR/Cas system can be harnessed to  
modify defunct alleles of useful genes or to knock out unwanted genes in plants  
without  any  trace  of  transgene.  Biotechnological  tools  and  techniques  provide  a  
unique opportunity to create novel useful variation which is instrumental for the rice  
breeders.
